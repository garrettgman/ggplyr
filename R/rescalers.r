#' rescale vectors to [0,1]
#' 
#' rescale_01 rescales every vector in a list of vectors to the range [0, 1]. 
#' rescale_01 rescales the vectors as a group (instead of rescaling each vector 
#' independently). This is a helpful feature for rescaling related variables (such 
#' as xmin and xmax) without nullifying the difference between the two.
#' 
#' If a vector is a character or factor vector, rescale_01 attempts to coerce it 
#' to numeric before scaling. The scale is determined by finding the range of 
#' values contained in the list of vectors and mapping it ot [0, 1]. 
#' 
#' If the full range of values to be scaled is not present in the vectors, users 
#' can specify the range to be scaled to [0,1] with the xlim argument. Values in 
#' the vectors will be rescaled as if they according to this range.
