NATO CLASSIFICATION: NATO CONFIDENTIAL REL ISAF RELIABILITY/CREDIBILITY: C-3. DATE OF REPORT: 20050910. LOCATION: Chakmani, Paktya Province; Deh-Rawud, Uruzgan Province, AF OVERVIEW: Terrorism  Air Threat. Follow up to ADET-CIINTREP-2005-VII-415. Taliban moves two Man-Portable Air Defense System (MANPAD) rockets from Kandahar Province to the Paktya and Uruzgan Provinces. TEXT: 1. During the month of August, Mullah OMAR ordered that two of the six Stinger-type MANPADs be moved to the Paktya and Uruzgan Provinces respectively. Shortly after the order was issued, Taliban elements moved the MANPADs to the Paktya and Uruzgan Provinces. 2. One MANPAD was moved to the village of Chakmani (Geocoord: 334800 N 694900 E) which is near the city of Gardez in the Paktya Province. The MANPAD was placed in a valley just outside Chakmani. At the west end of the valley is a Government of Afghanistan Forces base, Not Further Specified (NFS), and at the east of the valley is a National Assembly and Provincial Council Elections facility, NFS. These two facilities are approximately five to ten kilometers from one another on opposites ends of the valley. Taliban has observed a number of Coalition Forces (CF) aircraft in this area, and may be planning to attempt to use the MANPADs against CF Aircraft. 3. The second MANPAD was moved to the Deh-Rawud (Geocoords unavailable) area in the Uruzgan Province. Again, Taliban may be planning to attempt to use the MANPADs against CF Aircraft. 4. Mullah MUJAHED, Commander of Taliban forces in the Uruzgan Province and close confidant of Mullah OMAR, was in charge of transporting the MANPADs to these areas. 5. The remaining four MANPADs remain stored in the village of Panjwai, near the city of Kandahar, AF. COMMENTS: 1. Reference ADET-CIINTREP-2005-VII-415. BACKGROUND: On approximately 13 JUL 05, three individuals entered Afghanistan from Iran carrying six MANPADS. The individuals entered Afghanistan at Rabata-Jali (Coordinates unavailable; Rabata-Jali lies on the Afghan-Iran border at the extreme southwest tip of Afghanistan). The individuals traveled to Panjwai, near the city of Kandahar, AF. The three Iranian individuals delivered the MANPADS to a small group of Taliban individuals in the area. The MANPADS are currently stored near Panjwai. The MANPADS delivered to the Taliban elements were made in Iran and very closely resemble US-made Stinger MANPADS, so much so that the MANPADS appear to be exact Stinger replicas. When news of the delivery of these MANPADS reached senior Taliban leadership in Quetta, PK, senior Taliban leadership ordered Taliban elements within the Afghan National Army (ANA) to find individuals with experience in firing MANPADS, and to attempt to recruit these individuals to fire the MANPADS on behalf of the Taliban. Senior Taliban leadership gave specific instructions to attempt to recruit individuals with MANPAD expertise from the ranks of the ANA Anti-Aircraft Division within Kabul.

3.A.1. (S-GCTF) HIG LEADER WARNS OF SUMMER IED ATTACKS.  As of early 2006, HIG leader Hekmatyar Gulbuddin claimed that HIG and TB had four mobile cells operating inside Afghanistan, who planned to conduct IED and suicide bombing attacks against CF in Jun or Jul 2006. The mobile cells were based in Herat, Kandahar and Zarmat, Afghanistan. The terrorist cells were equipped with motorcycles, bicycles, and automobiles, which were configured to be VBIEDS. The cells also had explosive laden vests, which weighed approximately seventeen kilograms. Suicide bomber cell members planned to wear the vests and either drives a motorcycle or walks into a coalition convoy and then detonates the device. Pulling the cord on the vest could detonate the devices. The vest reportedly has a kill radius of approximately twenty feet and would destroy a car as long as if located within this distance. In addition, Hekmatyar reportedly claimed that cell members would be rewarded monetarily for various attacks. Families of the suicide bombers would be provided U.S. $20,000. Cell members who killed an American would be rewarded U.S. $5,000, and cell members who killed an Afghan solider or a pro-Afghan government mullah would be rewarded U.S. $1,000.

Taliban suicide bombers sent to MEYMANEH, FARYAB Province
(Ref.: PRT MEY INTREP 06-002 060816)
(N/I S) At the 16th of August at 15:50 a PRT MEY CS received information that the TALIBAN bombers mentioned in this SPEC INTREP is now on route from MAZAR-E Sharif to MEYMANEH, FARYAB province. Reportedly they drive a car, unknown brand or colour. The group consist of four persons. They are reported to be headed for the house of Abdul GHANI. Further information about this group are to be found in this SPECINTREP.
(N/I S) Reportedly a high level meeting was held in QUETTA, PAKISTAN where six suicide bombers were given orders for an operation in Northern Afghanistan. Two persons have been given targets in KUNDUZ, two in MAZAR-E-SHARIF and the last two are said to come to FARYAB . 
(N/I S) These meetings take place once every month, and there are usually about twenty people present. The place for the meeting alternates between QUETTA and villages (NFDG) on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The top four people in these meetings are Mullah OMAR, OSAMA BIN LADEN, Mullah DADULLAH and Mullah BARADER (PHON). Mullah DADULLAH is called DADULLAH LANG, because he is missing a leg.
(N/I S) The six foreigners who have been given the assignment, have each been given USD 50.000 to conduct the attacks, and they have been promised that their families will be taken care of. It is not known what nationality these foreigners are from, but allegedly one is Chinese. The prices for suicide attacks are equivalent to the difficulty of the task and how important the target is. It is more expensive to target a commander than an employee from an NGO. Allegedly the attacker who was tasked to kill DOSTUM in KABUL three months ago was paid one million dollars. Reportedly the ordinary ""salary"" for suicide attacks is between USD 50-100.000. This could possibly indicate that the targets for this attack are low-level and/or easily accessible. 
(N/I S) A group of Taliban terrorists bound for Afghanistan left Pakistan yesterday, 14th August 2006. The group has entered Afghanistan, and is probably in either KANDAHAR or HELMAND. The main group will be split up in single groups assigned to conduct suicide attacks in different Provinces. Each group is allocated to a specific Province. A single group consist of a non-Afghan suicide operative, and a logistical and administrative support team of three or four people. There were six or seven suicide operatives with the main group. This means that there are six or seven single groups who are assigned to carry out suicide attacks in different provinces of Afghanistan.
(N/I S) The attackers will either use a VBIED or an explosive vest. The six people designated for this attack has been trained by AHMAD MURGHABI (PHON) in Pakistan. Mullah AKHTAR OSMANI is the one who is in charge of suicide attacks, and is the one who planned the operation. 
(N/I S) MURGHABI is a close associate of Mullah BARADER, and has regular meetings with him. MURGHABI is the one who is responsible for the teaching of suicide bombers and also improvised explosive devices and guerrilla warfare. He has twelve new students now, all whom are from GHOR. They will most likely only be taught IED's and Guerilla warfare, since Afghans normally don't conduct suicide bombings.
(N/I S) Among the main group who entered Afghanistan were Taliban's shadow Governors for each of the provinces where suicide attacks will be made. The Governors may travel with the group assigned to conduct suicide attacks in their province.
-Taliban's appointed Governors for the Northern Provinces of Afghanistan are currently in MORGHAB on the border between FARYAB and GHOR. These are:
-Maulawi GUL AHMAD (PHON). He is the appointed governor for JAWZJAN, and the acting governor for SARI PUL.
-Commander AHMAT (PHON). He is the appointed governor for GHOR.
-Maulawi ASIM (PHON). He is currently the governor for FARYAB, but is due to be changed in the near future (NFDG).
(N/I S) Mullah OMAR is currently not pleased with the way the Taliban shadow Governor for FARYAB, Mullah ASEM (PHON), is carrying out his tasks. Taliban maintains shadow Governors for the different provinces of Afghanistan. These are responsible for Taliban activity within their province, and receive money from Mullah OMAR. The money is expected to be used to administrate, manage and execute terrorist attacks and other insurgent activities inside Afghanistan. 
(N/I S) Reportedly Mullah OMAR called Taliban's shadow Governor for FARYAB, Mullah ASEM (PHON), and asked him why he wasn't taking the opportunity to hand out weapons and escalate the situation in the planned demonstrations in MEYMANEH. Mullah OMAR has sent money to Mullah ASEM (PHON) and wants insurgency activities to be carried out as a result of the funding.
(N/I S) If Mullah ASEM (PHON) is to be replaced, the next Taliban shadow Governor is likely to be Mullah Abdul BAQI. 
(N/I S) One of the single groups has been selected to go to Faryab Province and conduct a suicide attack in MEYMANEH (41S PV 600 760) . The exact time for the attack is not yet known, but the target will be any foreigners, including ISAF and UN in MEYMANEH. The exact nature of the attack is unknown, but it may be either vehicle born, or carried out by the operative wearing a suicide vest. The group bound for MEYMANEH carries explosives with them from Pakistan. The exact route and means of travel for the Taliban operatives bound for FARYAB has not yet been decided.
(N/I S) The MEYMANEH group is led by Haji HAFIZ from KANDAHAR or QUETTA. HAFIZ is of light build and has a black beard with tones of white. He has cut his beard short in order to avoid resemblance with a typical Taliban member. His two deputies are FNU HABIBULLAH and Mullah MUJAHED, both from CHARBOLAR (GNK) in MASAR e SHARIF (42S UF 3164). The suicide operative is an unknown foreigner. 
(N/I S) The group will travel to MAZAR E SHARIF before moving on to MEYMANEH. While in MAZAR E SHARIF, the group will stay in the home of Mullah MUJAHID.
(N/I S) While in MEYMANEH, the group will stay in Abdul GHANI's house near the Meymaneh River (GNK). GHANI is a Kakari Pasthu, and a friend of Mullah DADULLAH LANG, a high ranking Taliban official. Abdul GHANI is possibly from KARTI AFSARAN (PHON) (GNK) either in MAZAR E SHARIF or MEYMANEH.
(N/I S) PRT MEY Comment: No further details are known about the actual targets, the timings or the nature of the intended operations. PRT MEY does not hold any documentation that such operations have been conducted in FARYAB the recent years. 
(N/I R) CHARBOLAR (GNK) in MASAR e SHARIF can be CHAHAR BOLAK (42S TF 965 704) in CHAHAR BOLAK district, BALKH Province.
(N/I S) Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) runs a training facility in QUETTA, and train Pakistani activists from Jamyat-Ul-Talabah (PHON) and Harakat Islami Kashmir (PHON) as well as  Chechens, Uzbeks, Afghans and Arabs. 
(N/I S) Reportedly PRT KONDOZ has been informed that two VBIED, one silver Toyota Corolla and one yellow-white taxi Toyota Corolla, was found by ANP in KONDOZ City, KONDOZ Province. The drivers of the cars have been arrested. 
(N/I S) HAJI HAFIZ could be HAFIZ that has earlier served as guide and supplier for suicide bombers in KANDAHAR. HAFIZ means of transport has earlier been a TOYOTA COROLLA TAXI. HAFIZ is believed to originate from FARAH province in AFGHANISTAN. 
(N/I S) Mullah MUJAHED is possible ANWAR AL-HAQ, aka MUJAHED. MUJAHED is not a common name, but often seen as a label for veteran mujahedin fighters. ANWAR AL-HAQ is earlier reported to be a TALIBAN commander thought to be conducting insurgent activities in NANGARHAR province, AFGHANISTAN. Mullah MUJAHED might also be ANWARUL HAQ MUJAHED, listed as TALIBAN in charge of NANGARHAR province as of April 2006. He is reportedly close to TALIBAN leader Mullah OMAR.
(N/I S) ABDUL GHANI may possible be identical with the ABDUL GHANI suspected of conducting VBIED attacks against ANSF and IC in the KANDAHAR. Suspected insurgents in KANDAHAR ABDUL HABIB and MUHAMMAD TOWOS, both sons of ABDUL GHANI, was arrested together with infamous terrorist operative SHAD GUL in KANDAHAR in February 2006. They were suspected of prepairing a TOYOTA HILUX SURF with explosives and remote control to be used as a VBIED.  
(N/I S) The shadow governor for FARYAB Maulawi ASIM is the same as Mullah Asem MUTAQI, instated approx early 2004. He is a Pasthu from CHOR DARYA (grid 41SPA655390 or 41SPA675405) or DAWLATABAD (41SPA7232), but currently recides with his close family in QUETTA, Pakistan. He still has relatives in DAWLATABAD (41SPA7232). Early 2005 MUTAQI held influence in ALMAR, QAYSAR and KHWAYA NAMOSA districts of FARYAB province. After NDS made an attempt to arrest him, he escaped to QUETTA in PAKISTAN. 
(N/I S) PRT MEY Assessment: The recent reports on possible suicide bombers must be taken seriously due to the serious nature of the stated information. All reports regarding this issue must be seen in connection with each other, but not used as verification to either. An earlier reporting stated that the suicide bombers had not yet entered Afghanistan. That information is contradicted in this report.
(N/I S) Possible suicide bombers will most likely be revealed by the Uzbek population in the lucid FARYAB. They might find support and hide among the general Pashtu population pending action. But since there is no known support organization, they are most likely to operate independently, or bring own support team. The historic lack of equivalent events does not imply that such actions could not occur, but there is presently not enough information available to determine the credibility. If true, the terrorists will probably attack targets to either undermine the perception of GoA as able to provide security or bodies which they identify with Western imperialism. These would probably be soft targets and mainly effect the population. The most likely nature of an attack against ISAF would be a version of an IED / VBIED, but amplifying information is required to make an assessment of the nature and probability of the threat 
(N/I C) There has been sporadic reporting about Taliban activities in connection to the Pasthun nomads present during the summer and in the Pashtun populated areas, but there has been no specific information that provides a reasonable probability of TALIBAN hostile presence. Uzbek commanders use the alleged presence of TALIBAN as justification for not handing in weapons and the villagers use these arguments as leverage in the persisting land and water disputes. 
(N/I C) The Uzbeks have a historical hatred for TALIBAN and have been assessed most likely to possess both the will and ability to hinder TALIBAN in getting a foothold in FARYAB. The seriously unsuccessful harvest, the drought and thereby the worsening living conditions seem to have mitigated most of the ethnic tension and was assessed to rather increase criminal activity. PRT MEY has surveyed the Pashtun areas the recent weeks to validate whether the allegedly worsened living conditions due to the rule of Uzbek Commanders could nurture and fuel radicalism without finding substantial proves. The absence of such indications does not omit that there could be people supportive to TALIBAN. In given circumstances they might be supportive or ally themselves with terrorist elements. 
(N/I S) However the continued and detailed information gained through several reports lately can at best be viewed as a deception attempt. In worst case scenario the reported insurgents will try to carry through with their mission against ISAF and the IC.
(N/I S) Due to the heat the insurgents are receiving from NDS and Afghan National Security Forces in KANDAHAR and KABUL and the presence of highly capable ISAF and Coalition forces in the Southern part of AFGHANISTAN, it is likely that they are looking for a easier way to conduct their operations. FARYAB with its quiet country living and few politically or religiously motivated hostile impacts against the IC will without a doubt present itself as a easy target for such OMF forces as the TALIBANS described. 
(N/I S) PRT MEY COA Assessment: However it is difficult to point out one single reaction for force protection as the correct one in a case like this. The PRT should keep up its regular work, but tighten up the security awareness and routines. No unit must fall into the trap of being predictable in its conduct of duty or choice of path. The intelligence gathering will continue in order to reveal the insurgents.

TB Preparations for Autumn Offensive in Helmand and Oruzgan Province: On or about 23 July 2006, Agha Mohammad Osmani, operational CDR in Helmand Province said he had received orders from PAK to prepare for a large-scale TB offensive in Helmand and Oruzgan Province. Reportedly, the attack will commence on 20 August 2006 and continue for one-month, concluding 20 September 2006. Osmani pointed out the autumn offensive is the major offensive preceding winter and that there is a shortage of specific weapons such as short-range rockets and anti-aircraft rockets. According to Osmani, a TB delegation was in Iran attempting to procure the weaponry. Osmani commented that the relationship between the TB and Iran has never been stronger. (PIR: 1) 

CJSOTF-A ASSESSMENT: (S//REL USA, AUS and ISAF) This report further corroborates event analysis that there will be a Fall offensive in RC South. However, due to the lack of source credibility we are unable to confirm the veracity of this report at this time. We assess that there will likely be a Fall offensive and the TB will likely focus on Helmand and Oruzgan Provinces, where the TB has had the most success this year in conducting direct fire ambushes, and maintaining indirect fire and IED activity IVO Kandahar City.

INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY
30 Dec 06
(290300Z Dec 06 - 300259Z Dec 06)
Country-Wide Threats:  
(N/I R) On approximately 17 December 2006, following a meeting between senior members of the TALIBAN leadership in NOWSHAHRA, Pakistan (GEOCOORD NOT AVAILABLE), which included General Hamid GUL, the former Chief of Inter-Services Intelligence  (ISI) Directorate of Pakistan.  During this meeting GUL claimed he dispatched three unidentified individuals to KABUL City (GEOCOORD: 42S WD 15172 19937) to carry out IED attacks during the Eid celebration.  GUL instructed two of the individuals to plant IEDs along the roads frequently utilized by Government of Afghanistan (GOA) and ISAF vehicles.  The third individual is to carry out a suicide attack utilizing a suicide vest against GOA or ISAF entities.  Reportedly GULs final comment to the three individuals was make the snow warm in KABUL, basically telling them to set KABUL aflame.
(N/I R) The three individuals traveled from SOROBI (GEOCOORD: 42S WD 6817430407), SOROBI District KABUL Province to their current location in the MUSAYI District, KABUL Province, (GEOCOORD NOT AVAILABLE) NFI.  The two individuals tasked with planting the IEDs will employ two types of IEDs, these being remotely detonated IEDs and a supposedly new Chinese made magnetic mine.  The three individuals tasked with conducting these attacks will be assisted in entering KABUL City by a group of five unidentified individuals, described as a KABUL Province criminal gang that is associated with General AMANULLAH GOUZAR, the current KABUL City Chief of Police.
(N/I R) The Chinese made magnetic mines were described as a metal plate with a magnet attached to one side and the explosives to the other.  The mines are to be planted on roads frequently used by ISAF and GOA forces throughout KABUL, utilizing the snow as camouflage.  Reportedly, once a vehicle drives over the camouflaged plated mine the magnetic side will attach itself to the passing vehicle.  As the vehicle departs the area one of the unidentified individuals acting as a spotter will contact the second individual, who will be located on higher ground overlooking the road, via a cellular phone notifying him the package was picked up.  In addition, the spotter will also relay the vehicle description to include its license plate number or vehicle description.  Once the second individual receives this information and observes the vehicle he will then remotely detonate the mine.  GUL reportedly has received approximately 50 of these mines in order for them to carry out their operation.

LTC Bilal and his staff of the Frontier Corps unit, PAKMIL

4.  Meeting With:

6.  Discussion Items:
Border security, commo plan, joint patrols, IDF

7.  Commitments/Agreements:
Nothing concrete; potential for future engagements, radio comms

8.  Assessment:
PAKMIL not an effective disruption force; the leadership sounded to be on the right path, but it was not echoed in the actions of the unit.

9.  Attachments: (photos, notes, etc)

On 7FEB07, 2-321 (ABN) FA conducted a Border Flag Meeting with an adjacent PAKMIL commander.  The PAKMIL contingent met us near one of their check points in the middle of a large wadi vic. (WB865640), displaying a white flag.  They had a few individuals dispersed throughout the wadi as well as some OPs on the high ground.  Their compound was around a bend in the wadi, but we never saw it.  There were approximately 50 PAKMIL visible throughout the wadi and surrounding high ground.  They were loosely patrolling, but not in an aggressive stance at all.
Although we brought an interpreter, we soon learned he was unnecessary.  The individuals we met with spoke excellent English.  The leader was Lieutenant Colonel Bilal, and artilleryman, who commanded a Frontier Corps battalion.  With him was a MAJ who was in charge of a standard army unit working with the Frontier Corps battalion.  Together, their unit was responsible for approximately 17 km of the AF-PK border along southern Khowst province. 
The colonel didnt waste any time getting to the point saying that there needs to be more communication between the two forces on either side of the border.  He complained that his unit receives indirect fire from the AF side of the border while trying to conduct patrols.  Bilal said that if we had better communication, this could be avoided and if we needed help, he could assist on his side with patrols.  Bilal also stated that we need to have regular monthly meetings between himself and the CF commander on the AF side.
He was interested in executing a commo plan he had negotiated with COL Donahue, over a year ago.  He lamented that COL Donahue had given him a phone number to contact him, but it had never been answered.  His plan was to conduct regular radio checks on two different freqs, 65.40 SC PT with his HQ in Ghulam Khan (WB 959678) and 55.40 SC PT with the Check Point near the site of the meeting.  They do radio checks at 0900 and 1800 Pakistan Standard Time (Z+5 hours) and want CF to conduct them as well.  His units call sign is Quaids Guards.  We successfully conducted a radio check with our radios on site.  Colonel Bilals next request was for rechargeable batteries for the AN/PRC-77 radios that he had been provided from an unknown source years before.  He had very few and was using an improvised car battery.  Bilal also provided two phone numbers for Thuraya phones: 89803358 and 89851380 for us to use to contact his HQ.  We gave him the battalions Thuraya phone number as well and we said we would look into more batteries and radio checks, but made no promises.  He finished his points by saying that future meetings should be held at his HQ in Ghulam Khan.  
He was also very interested in our array of forces and locations of Border Security Points; as he said to avoid accidental fighting.  Of course we were vague and changed the subject.
We asked about their border security plan.  They conduct three basic operations: patrols, checkpoints, and observation posts.  Bilal and his team explained they run constant patrols along the border and successfully enforce a curfew within 3 km of the border.  (Comment:  This is highly unlikely.  Reporting indicates that movement from PK to AF during hours of darkness has happened recently.  Also, due to the terrain, it would take constant patrolling by PAKMIL and probably the use of night observation devices (which they do not have) to stop people from crossing the border in either direction at night.)  

The officers readily stated how focused they were to border security and stated that a lot of blame throwing has been done recently.  Bilal feels that this is unfair because the PAKMIL is doing its share.  They said that the security situation has improved as a result of the agreement made last year between TB, tribal leaders, and the PAKMIL in Waziristan.  When asked if he expected a violent Spring Offensive, Bilal stated that he did not believe so, because the Frontier Corps control is firm there is no organized group in Pakistan.  (Comment: This comment alone shows how disconnected this particular group of leadership is from what is going on in reality.  The security situation probably has improved in PK, but after the agreement, AF, particularly Khowst, has seen a 300% increase in enemy activity since the agreement.)  
Wrapping up, Bilal made a final proposal.  He stated his interest in organizing joint patrols along the border so that both sides will know the allies on the other side of the border.  
Following the formal discussion, they set a table of finger foods and chi.  We continued to talk discussing more personal histories and the two officers were very open and candid.  We took a group photo (they had taken several of us already while we were sitting there) and then left the way we came.

Comments: LTC Bilal truly seemed committed to assisting with border security.  He felt that his unit was doing a good job.  He is likely so disconnected with the ground truth that his own soldiers could be assisting TB border crossings.  He said on multiple occasions that if we on the AFG side noticed forces moving along the border to contact them and they would action.  I doubt that this would do any good because PAKMIL/ISI is likely involved with the border crossing, but it may be worth trying.  At least forewarning of IDF may be a good idea to gauge the response of the infiltrating unit.
Also, some reporting has indicated that PAKMIL is building a fence and mining their side of the border.  We saw no such thing and that was not one of the three measures they said that they were taking to increase border security (patrols, check points, and OPs).
Future meetings should be encouraged with well thought out talking points.  Either one of two things could result from further dialogue: 1) the PAKMIL could be leveraged to increase border security, or 2) or we can ascertain what elements in the PAKMIL are supporting cross border operations.

Arrived back safe and sound and it turned out to be quite a memorable day, specifically for the Brigadier and the TFK crew who had not really experienced anything like this during their tour in Afghanistan. The Pakmil were very hospitable, they were on time at the border and transported the party to Chaman Fort without event. At the fort they provided light refreshment with snacks and curry lunch with music post meeting. Presentations were made to the Brigadier and the ANP Chief and was reciprocated by the Canadian contingent. 
 
The meeting went ahead with the Pakmil echoing your sentiments, (we will need to do a rethink and get an SOP established for BFM) and I agree with you in that they should be little but often. However previous BFM&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s had been rather grand affairs (almost BSSM) which is why I introduced the Working groups after the last BSSM in order to combat the obvious gaps in the programme, but I do agree and we do need to keep the ANSF interested, they were slightly perturbed at the structure of the Pakmil presence but we discussed this issue during the meeting and arrived at the same conclusion, so now we can work on that point and resolve it. 
 
They were really keen on the communications part of the meeting, which is strange considering they have been reluctant to complete the first part of the training programme. However I spoke in depth with the Comms Officer during lunch, he did not see the requirement to train until the new radios were issued, but when I explained that it would be an ideal opportunity to firstly get to know your counterparts and to plan future SOP&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s and Exercises before the radios arrived. They now fully support the idea and are willing to go ahead. I will speak to J6 here tomorrow and propose a date to meet, still feel that they will be reluctant to travel to Afghanistan. (even though this was impressed upon them during the meeting)
 
An interesting point was raised by the Colonel Masud during the meeting that in RC(E) CF went into Pakistan and killed a Pakmil and took 3 or 4 more soldiers hostage, this was last night apparently, we obviously could not comment but promised that we would look into it on our return. 
 
The meeting was heading in the direction of a nice meeting without any controversial points or issues been raised. At this juncture I spoke to both parties to and informed them that this was their opportunity to be open with each other and speak freely. Indeed this would be the forum to raise these issues and to get concerns out in the open, that spurred them on and then we had a number of useful albeit diplomatic issues raised.
 
The meeting concluded with relationships and dialogue between the Pakistan and Afghanistan certainly much improved than at the start, this should be a good stepping stone for the future meetings. it is now imperative that we follow this up very closely with the Communication Ex as soon as possible, this will give credibility to the purpose of this flag meeting. 
 
I will be in touch regards the Islamabad Conference tomorrow when I have had the opportunity to discuss the issue with the key players.

     Initially, the only signs of town inhabitants were trash and feces in the streets. The people stayed inside until the Apaches left station; they were mostly unresponsive, even when we told them that we had brought HA- they were not impressed as they did not believe that they would get any of it. HUMINT collection was virtually fruitless. 
     What little infrastructure they have is crumbling and the quality of life is extremely poor.  Come summer and spring, the hygiene conditions will worsen and be cause for concern. 
     HUMINT Assessment: As we walked into the Bazaar, we noticed no one was in the street. We could see people in their shops; doors were closed and very few smiles or waves were returned.  A few people were receptive as we spoke to them.  We did receive some mean looks.  They wondered why we were coming in with such force.  We told them that we had a lot EOF HA for their village. They expressed concern that the HA would not be fairly distributed.  Security was not an issue, according to the people with whom we spoke.  Their main concern is the water supply and buildings collapsing due to the recent rain.  They said people who have been working outside of Afghanistan will be returning in a nother month or two.  These people have been in Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. 
Key Leader Engagement Assessment: Met with MAJ Rafiki (ANP Chief of Police), Mirr Akbar (Criminal Officer), COL Latifi (Logar ANP XO), and the Mullah/Platoon Leader.  Took a tour of the compound and spoke about the physical security issues they were having and also made some recommendations about their improvements. We discussed previous attacks on the ANP station and the reasons for them (i.e.- why they were coming from different directions, etc). After the tour, we sat down to chai. We discussed the HA distribution in detail with the ANP CoP. From the first five minutes, there seemed to be an ongoing discussion between COL Latifi and MAJ Rafiki. As the engagement progressed, the interaction became more heated. The interpreter explained that MAJ Rafiki was complaining about something. 
Absent was the Sub-governor. We were told that he would be there, but he decided not to come. He doesnt live in the town- he lives about 30-45 minutes away and drives himself to work. He does not have a driver or a bodyguard and it is strange that he drives himself (alone) to work in Kharwar.  This may indicate that he is not worried about anti-government or government threats, which may mean he has both in his pocket. 
The ANP CoP seems like the best among the worst; he understood what we were talking about concerning the equitable distribution of the HA. However, he made several comments about the people of Kharwar- how they should get jobs and how he had little influence. We got the impression that he has little concern for the needs of his people. We tried to impress upon him the difference between the people and a civil servant and he seemed to understand, if not agree. The ANP CoP is from the Konar district, so he has no family in Kharwar, which is a good thing as he may normally be tempted to give hand-outs to his family first.  We discussed the plan to use the Shura, the Red Crescent and the Sub-governor to distribute the HA; he seemed to understand what  we were saying about his job being easier if the people trusted him to support them. He mentioned that he had a meeting with the Taliban Leaders in Kharwar. At that point, we asked him Do you know who they are?! and he said yes, of course. At this point in the conversation, COL Latifi kicked out the criminal officer and the mullah/platoon leader. We began to discuss a mission that the ANP had with the 10th MTN. They were talking about what a failure the mission was because of the terrible intelligence they had received.   We tried to ask about the Taliban leaders and the recent intel we have received, but at that point, the apaches returned on station and it was time to establish the HLZ. 
As we were walking out, the heated discussion between COL Latifi and MAJ Rafiki flared up again- apparently, the Criminal Officer had drawn his weapon on MAJ Rafiki and threatened him either this morning or last night. According to MAJ Rafiki, the Criminal Officer had been bribed to kill him. MAJ Rafiki said that he was going to quit if he had to continue to work with the Criminal Officer.  We were trying to leave, but a crowd of ANP gathered and the heated discussion almost came to a head. We loudly told COL Latifi  that we had to get on the helicopter and if he wanted me to arrest the criminal officer, we would. He said that he didnt want to arrest him, but wanted to take him back to Pul-e-Alam for interrogation and to fire him at least. We searched the Criminal Officer and found one 9mm pistol with 3 rounds in the magazine.  We took the weapon from him and returned it to COL Latifi after we landed at Pul-e-Alam.
The Mullah/Platoon Leader assumed himself in positions of closeness to whomever he felt was the most powerful of the group. We asked who he was, and was told he was a platoon leader. We asked his name and they called him Mullah- according to the Terp, this is strange. 

Other: As we walked through the bazaar, there were no shop doors open and few people peeked out from behind windows or curtains.  The bazaar was a canalizing tunnel and the impression was of walking into a trap/ambush.  There were stray animals and barnyard feces in the street and trash was thrown out of doorways without concern. There were several dead dogs inside the ANP compound and throughout the town. Also, there was human feces everywhere, without regard for foot traffic or modesty. Several of the bunkers and trenches had obviously been used as latrines, despite the fact that there is a latrine facility in the compound. Not only was the facility in disrepair, it appeared as though the occupants were maliciously negligent. Yesterday, we gave several tarps and sandbags to the ANP to patch a caved in roof, but the tarps had not been used to make any repairs. 

Note: The DSHKA gunner is a LT, who apparently spends his nights on the megaphone, talking to the Taliban- taunting them and telling them what a good shot he is.

Dutch direct fire on an apparent enemy target in support of a village under Taliban attack ended tragically.  Four villagers engaged in the fight to defend Chenartu were killed and another seven wounded.  The Dutch have launched an official investigation and have engaged in a proactive public relations campaign to prevent political fallout here and in the Netherlands.

On 01APR07 it was reported that approximately six months ago, IRAN bought seven (7) anti-aircraft missiles from Algeria. These were imported to IRAN and clandestinely transported from Mashhad, IRN (CNA) across the border into Afghanistan.
There are reports in the past stating that IRAN supplied the insurgency with MANPADS. However, this the first time we have had Algeria mentioned as a Point of Origin. There is nothing to support that ALG should intentionally sell arms to IRN with the purpose of them being delivered to the insurgents. Also, despite the reporting, we have yet to see any of these alleged MANPADS actually being used.

SUMMARY

1.  (C) Afghanistan is acutely aware of US concerns over Iran&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s nuclear program and will study US non-paper and UNSCR 1747.  Foreign Minister Spanta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s Senior Policy Advisor, Davood Moradian, expressed to Embassy April 4 concerns over the formation of both the National Unity Council and National Front which he characterized as creatures of Iran and Russia.  He expressed concern they represented a return to &amp;quot;the politics of the 1990s&amp;quot; and underlined Afghanistan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s wish for improved relations with its neighbors, particularly Iran, in order to marginalize foreign influences in the country.  Moradian requested US assistance to beef up the MFA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s public affairs function.  END SUMMARY

Iran Sanctions
--------------

2.  (C) On April 4, during a regular periodic meeting, PolCouns delivered ref A (regarding UNSCR 1747 which imposes new sanctions on Iran) to Foreign Minister Spanta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s Senior Policy Advisor, Davood Moradian.  Moradian said he was well aware of US concerns and would study the points and get back to Embassy with any reactions.

National Unity Council: Iran and Russia Behind It
--------------

3.  (C) PolCouns raised US concerns over the emergence of the new National Unity Council (NUC) which wants to place restrictions on international military forces in Afghanistan (ref B).  Moradian agreed it was a very troublesome development.  He said Iran and Russia were clearly behind the NUC and were working together.  Moradian believes that the new National Front (ref C), which is advocating a Parliamentary system and the direct election of governors, is also an Iranian-Russian product.  He said many were concerned that &amp;quot;puppets&amp;quot; of Iran, Pakistan and India were emerging in the Parliament and organizing themselves into various groups.  Moradian expressed concern that the &amp;quot;politics of the 1990s&amp;quot; were again being played out in Afghanistan.

4.  (C) Regarding the NUC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s future prospects, Moradian said much would depend on how the NUC presented itself to President Karzai and how Karzai would be able to manipulate the group himself.  Karzai needed to form his own political group since his supporters were fragmented while the opposition was united.  Moradian said that Karzai would run for re-election but would need to make changes or he would be defeated.  He described Karzai as showing courage in dealing with Pakistan and needing to display the same qualities in confronting his domestic opponents.  In response to PolCounselor reiterating US concern with Karzai using the press -- including the American press -- to criticize Pakistan, Moradian said that President Karzai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s attacks on Pakistan should not be viewed as personal attacks on Musharraf.

Managing Relations With Iran
--------------

5.  (C) Moradian explained that &amp;quot;special representatives&amp;quot; from the Iranian government had recently visited Foreign Minister Spanta to express GoI concern over the resurgence of the Taliban.  Iran had expressed concern about Musa Qala, arguing that Taliban success in Helmand gave them no choice but to prepare themselves for the possible return to power of the Taliban in the western provinces and possibly nationally.  Moradian explained that one of the reasons Afghanistan needed normal relations with Iran was to marginalize the pro-Iranian groups in the country.  He noted that the US-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership caused friction with Afghanistan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s neighbors, but particularly since its neighbors were not being helpful on security, Afghanistan made no excuses for choosing to go outside the region for security guarantees (i.e., the US and ISAF).  The US would remain the priority country for Afghanistan but a balance had to be struck between forging a close relationship with the US and not being perceived as a threat to its neighbors.

6.  (C) Moradian said relations with Russia required a similar balancing act.  He shared that Foreign Minister Spanta had tried to convince the Russians that the best way to have good relations with Afghanistan was not by means of close relations with the Northern Alliance.  Russia did not need them to improve its relations with Afghanistan.  Similarly with India, Moradian said that it had a tendency to try to go beyond the Afghan central government when it should be strengthening relations with core institutions.  Moradian repeated that Afghanistan did not want a return to the &amp;quot;politics of the 1990s&amp;quot;.

New US Central Command Commander, Admiral William J. Fallon, met March 31 with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.  They discussed Musharraf&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s participation at the recent Arab League Summit (disappointing), Musharraf&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s interest in engaging on Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts (as a go-between), his efforts to construct an alliance of moderate Muslim states (slow going), the situation in Iraq (Sunnis need to be given more), continuing concerns about Iran (too unpredictable), and the status of Pakistan-Afghanistan relations and a plea for better understanding of Pakistan&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s perspective (can&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;t trust President Karzai).  Admiral Fallon explored with Musharraf ways that the Government of Pakistan could improve security control and economic prosperity in the FATA and adjacent areas.

A.Type of patrol:Mounted

B.Task and Purpose of Patrol: 3/A/2-87 IN conducts a leader engagement and HCA Distribution in the village of Mamadi (42SWB401383) NLT 160500ZApril2007 IOT increase support for Coalition Forces and the IRoA.  


C.Time of Return: 161015ZAPR2007

D.Routes used and Approximate times from point A to B:
             
From Grid/FOBTo Grid/FOBRouteTravel
42SWB42614380/Tillman42SWB401383/MamadiRTE Honda/BMW/Corvette10-15km/h
42SWB401383/Mamadi42SWB42614380/TillmanRTE Honda/BMW/Corvette10-15km/h


E.Disposition of routes used: RTE Honda is classified at green.  Most of the road is dry, but has small streams running in and out of it.  RTE BMW is also classified as green and the streams also run in and out of it like RTE Honda.  RTE Corvette is classified at red.  It is extremely muddy and the tightness of the road makes it hard to move through there.  A HMMWV can only travel at about 5 km/h.  The road is also eroding away and forces the HMMWVs to slide into the sides of the wadi.  
     
F.Equipment status:  One US HMMWV was broken in the vicinity of 42SWB401400.  Part of the steering broke and needed to be replaced.  This took about one hour to fix.  Since we were only about a kilometer from the village, we moved half the patrol to Mamadi, 42SWB401383, and conducted the engagement while they fixed the HMMWV.  


G.Summary:  Since the weather system moving in, shortened our engagement, not much was learned from the elder.  He is a very disgruntled man with coalition forces.  He blames us for stealing his AK-47 and doesnt want any cerp projects or handout HCA.  He simply wants us to deliver money to his village and he will take care of it.  There was only about 4 kids present.  It seems to always be this way when we go there.  No one wants anything to do with us there.  

H.Local Nationals encountered:  

A. 
Position: Village Elder (Tribe:  Mandarkhil / Subtribe:  Mamakhil)
Location: Mamadi, 42SWB401383
General Information:  70 y/o male, grey hair and beard, 65 inches tall, and 145 lbs.  He isnt very cooperative with coalition forces.  Most of the information stated above had to be pulled from him, he does not want to be seen helping coalition forces.  


B. 
Position:  Villager (Tribe:  Mandarkhil / Subtribe:  Lalakhil)
Location: Tangeray, 42SWB419407
General Information:  30 y/o male, black hair, about 70 in tall, 150 lbs, skinny in stature.  Not very outgoing, sits on the edge of the conversation and just listens to what is going on.  Was previously detained during OEF V for involvement with IEDs.  He also use to work for ASF, but was fired for the involvement with the IEDs stated above.


Disposition of local security: There were about 15 ASG Soldiers pulling security along RTE Corvette as we moved through this area.   We also had 6 ANA that secured the high ground when we stopped.  

I.HCA Products Distributed: 30 X sweaters, 30 X backpacks, 10 X bags of beans, 10 X bags of rice

J.Products Distributed: UXO leaflets, ANA and ANP/ABP propaganda

K.Atmospherics: (reception of HCA, reactions to ANSF and Coalition forces, etc): All villagers/elders were extremely pleased with the products that we gave to them along.  Only the elder didnt want his village taking the products.  He personally blamed George Bush for his AK-47 being taken from him.  He doesnt want us to give stuff to his village because of fear from the enemy punishing him.  He did say he would take money though.  Only about 6 kids came out to get stuff.  We gave some stuff for the women of the village too.
 
L.Conclusion and Recommendation

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED:  The mission in Mamadi, was a success.  Even though our vehicle broke down, we were able to split the patrol to accomplish the leader engagement.  The vehicle was fixed by the time we were told to RTB because of an incoming wqeather system.  The village of Mamadi is definitely Anti-coalition.  They want nothing to do with U.S. or ANA forces.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) wants to keep the issue of the Iranian-made weapons recently found in Kandahar under the radar screen in the lead up to the June visit of the Iranian President to Afghanistan.  According to the MFA, President Karzai supports the plan to avoid additional friction with Afghanistan&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s neighbors and to issue no official public statements on the incident.  (This more moderate tone came across in Karzai&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s meeting with CJCS General Pace and Ambassador Wood on April 21 - septel). The MFA is asking its international partners to do the same.  Looking beyond the weapons issue, the MFA is aiming to construct a US-Afghan &amp;amp;quot;framework&amp;amp;quot; for managing relations with Iran, to be discussed during the proposed meeting between Secretary Rice and Spanta (date TBD).  The MFA has asked the Defense Ministry to determine the manufacturing date of the weapons to see if they might be from a different period when Iran was regularly supplying the Mujahedin

Former Ambassador to Afghanistan Ronald Neumann met with FCO officials May 14, en route to Islamabad, New Delhi and Central Asian capitals at the request of SCA A/S Boucher to shore up support for US policy on Afghanistan.  In separate conversations with the Foreign Office&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s South Asia and Afghanistan Director Adam Thomson and Afghanistan Group Head Richard Codrington, Amb. Neumann discussed the importance of using the June 11 to 12 US-UK bilaterals to make progress towards a joint position on the next counter-narcotics campaign, so that by September both countries along with the EU and ISAF can reach agreement with the GoA.  Neumann discussed how best to deal with President Karzai and promote reconciliation without negotiating with the Taliban, stressing the importance of close coordination in Kabul and the provinces.  He also called for more military trainers/advisers, especially from NATO countries that have spare capacity.  Thomson said the UK was considering making an additional battalion available for Afghanistan in addition to the one slated to deploy in fall 2007.  Thomson asked for USG help in ensuring that Canada and the Netherlands extend their military presence in Afghanistan.  Codrington stressed the need to reduce civilian casualties to the utmost, to get the GoA to take a strong stand against Iran&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s arming of the Taliban, and to get Pakistan to squeeze the Quetta Shura",RC CAPITAL,NEUTRAL,FALSE,"CJ3, CJTF-82",CJ3,None Selected,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42SWD1229945599,34.75244904,69.13437653,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,,,NEUTRAL,GREEN

(S//NF) PRT KANDAHAR: MID-MAY SECURITY ROUNDUP: (Source: AMEMBASSY KABUL 01691, 20 May 07)

A dramatic week was launched in Kandahar on May 12 with the killing of senior Taliban Commander Mullah Dadullah (in Helmand Province) and of Mullah Manan (in Zharey District) on May 13.  Many Kandaharis were jubilant and hundreds lined up to see his body on display at Governor Asadullah Khalid&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s palace.  In what may have been a calculated Taliban counterstrike, three explosions shook Kandahar on May 17, including one apparently targeting Governor Khalid but instead injuring Minister of Culture and Youth, Abdul Karim Khoram.  On May 15, Kandahar Provincial Reconstruction Team (KPRT) and the Afghan Independent Human Right Commission (AIHRC) hosted a first -- a meeting on human rights with Kandahar&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and other security sector leadership.  One issue that surfaced in this meeting and in a subsequent security meeting was growing concern by the provincial leadership over civilian casualties in ISAF operations.  Several recent examples were cited, including allegations that an ISAF convoy or convoys on May 15 in two city districts shot at least seven civilians of whom three died.  Governor Khalid and ANSF leaders also pressed for greater cooperation from ISAF and coalition forces on compound search techniques.  Lastly, estimates are that up to 200 Taliban are now operating in Zharey District, including Chechens and Uzbeks.",RC CAPITAL,NEUTRAL,FALSE,"CJ3, CJTF-82",CJ3,None Selected,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42SWD1229945599,34.75244904,69.13437653,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,,,NEUTRAL,GREEN

(S) STEPPED UP IRANIAN INFLUENCE REACHES FOREIGN MINISTRY: (Source: AMEMBASSY KABUL 01724, 23 May 07)

Over the past several months, Iran has taken a series of steps to expand and deepen its influence in Afghanistan.  Afghan contacts point to the creation of the National Front and the National Unity Council, the discovery of Iranian weapons in Afghanistan, Iran&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s control of media outlets and its growing cultural influence, and alleged direct financial support to members of Parliament as troubling evidence.  During May 15 meeting with PolCouns, ForMin Spanta&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s Senior Policy Advisor Davood Moradian accused Iranian agents of orchestrating Parliament&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s recent effort to oust the Foreign Minister.  According to Moradian (whose tenure at the MFA is tied to Spanta&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s), Spanta is one of several moderate secular reformers Iran has targeted for removal.  While Moradian alleged Iran paid USD 4 million to 80-90 members of Parliament for their support, MPs we talk to claim they were motivated by other factors, including Spanta&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s refusal to give up his German passport and poor performance on the issue of Afghans deported from Iran.  Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Safari visited Kabul on May 14 to protest Spanta&amp;amp;apos;&amp;amp;apos;s remarks criticizing Iran to Parliament.  One positive outcome of his visit was an agreement to send a GoA delegation to Tehran to discuss a more orderly return of Afghan refugees from Iran.",RC CAPITAL,NEUTRAL,FALSE,"CJ3, CJTF-82",CJ3,None Selected,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42SWD1229945599,34.75244904,69.13437653,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,,,NEUTRAL,GREEN

Suspected POO site is 41S PR 92801 71833.  A/C was traveling at approx. 70-80 Knots, 200-250ft AGL on an easterly heading when it was hit from the rear. The missile struck the aircraft in the left engine. The impact of the missile projected the aft end of the aircraft up as it burst into flames followed immediately by a nose dive into the crash site with no survivors. A/C was Lift 1, Serial 1, Chalk 2, but due a delay on HLZ to offload a gator, Flipper 75 along with Chalk 3 took off significantly after Chalk 1 and in effect became a second serial on the same route.  Chalk 3 witnessed a burst come from their SE approx. 300-500m away.  Chalk 3 did not witness a flare launch from Flipper 75 which is consistent with later missile launch at Arrow 25 (AH-64D) in same location that did not bring about CMWS flare launch.  Based on description of launch, size of round, and impact force of the projectile, it is assessed to be bigger then an RPG and possibly a Surface-to-Air Missile.

After supporting the first lifts insertion, they redirected their flight to cover a downed CH-47 at 41S PR 92946 72063.  While providing overhead cover to ground forces in the area, the AH-64s were engaged by a probable first-generation MANPAD.

The projectile was fired from around one kilometer to the southeast and maintained a constant trajectory.  Arrow 22 thought the projectile maintained the 700ft altitude, while Arrow 25 observed the projectile following an upward trajectory.  Neither crew observed a discernable smoke trail through their NVGs and both crews described the projectile as continuing in a generally straight line throughout its flight, although the Arrow 25 pilot later believed the projectile may have corkscrewed.  Due to the nature of the turning maneuver the aircraft were conducting, neither aircrew observed a self-detonation.

Executive Summary from Meeting with Gov Sherzai, (12 0730Z Jun 07):

The following personnel attended the meeting with Gov Sherzai:  Lt Col Phillips (PRT CDR), LTC Milhorn (TF RAPTOR), Danny Hall (DoS), LTC Muhamadullah (Deputy CDR, Unit 03), and Najib (PRT TERP).

Governor Sherzai began the meeting by describing the event as an unfortunate incident that occurred between friends and he further emphasized that he does not want to see this happen again.  Though not completely opposed to night operations, he strongly encourages better coordination.

Lt Col Phillips inquired of any press coverage and the governor indicated that he had pre-taped the following comments:

Afghan security forces conducted a joint operation with Coalition Forces (CF) to fight the enemy.The governor cited recent attacks by TB against police checkpoints, adding that many police were still cautious of any activity in the surrounding areas 

The governor described that the joint patrol was misdirected resulting in close contact made with police from Unit 03.  He indicated that Unit 03 reacted by engaging CF first.  CF then responded when attacked, resulting in numerous casualties. 

The governor emphasized this incident as a complete misunderstanding, again citing recent TB activities within the area and the immediate response to a perceived threat by both forces. 
 
Lt Col Phillips acknowledged the Governors concern and reiterated our support to prevent these types of events from occurring again. 

The governor indicated that he had received $2000 from OGA and he, himself, donated an additional $10,000 to Families/Elders for initial funeral expenses. 

The governor reported that his Deputy Governor, Afghan National Police Chief, and several line directors were already working to prevent any demonstrations.  The governor also reported that MOI and President Karzais office had also been notified.  Governor Sherzai advised that CF in Kabul should host a press conference to prevent negative messages from being used by the insurgents. 

When Lt Col Phillips emphasized the need for continued night operations, Governor Sherzai did not retaliate.  The governor acknowledged that many of the tribal elders and mullahs were opposed to night ops.  He only re-emphasized the need for improved coordination and intelligence sharing. If not done, bad things will continue to happen, he said.

The governor outlined future events to address many of the new concerns:

On Sunday, 17 Jun 07, he will host a Shura at the governors compound  inviting 10 tribal elders and leaders from each of the 22 districts across Nangarhar Province.  The governor requested that a general officer be present from Kabul (originally citing GEN McNeil).  Media will also be invited with no press conference to follow. 
Within the next few days, he will host the Families and Soldiers of Unit 03 at the compound for a funeral service and solatia event in an effort to show how much he cares for his children (the police). 

Lt Col Phillips further expressed his concern about the inability of ANSF to conduct night ops on their own and further concurred with the governors proposal that all operations should be conducted jointly.  The governor responded with agreement and stressed that ANSF should be in the lead with CF in trail.

After the governor concluded with his comments, I expressed my condolences to LTC Muhamadullah and the governor and reiterated our emphasis to conduct joint patrols routinely.  Additionally, I expressed my concern for the derogatory remarks made by LTC Safi, the Unit 03 Commander in Khogyani, and suggested that we meet in the near future.  LTC Muhamadullah suggested that we meet with LTC Safi within the next few days and follow-up with a meeting in Khogyani.

In closing, Governor Sherzai requested that the three trucks destroyed by CF be replaced.  He added that MOI had committed to sending three additional trucks to Unit 03, and at least 30 to the governor for distribution amongst his 22 sub-governors and special staff.  He indicated that he had given four of his personal vehicles to sub-governors, of which all had been destroyed by IEDs.

13 June 07 Meeting with BG Gul Nabi (Director of Education and Training for MOI) who was doing the official MOI investigation of the Force 03 incident.  Key points from the meeting:

Our sequence of events as discussed last night are the same as he received from Force 03, the ANP, and the Governor 
He stressed that they clearly understand this was an accident, and trust between all involved is still strong 
Appreciated our recommended coordination adjustments to ensure this type of incident does not occur again

The knowledge that TF-373 conducted a HIMARS strike must be kept protected.  All other information below is classified Secret / REL ISAF.  

(S) Mission: O/O SOTF conducts kinetic strike followed with HAF raid to kill/capture ABU LAYTH AL LIBI on NAI 2.

(S)Target: Abu Layth Al Libi is a senior al-Qaida military commander, Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) leader.  He is based in Mir Ali, Pakistan and runs training camps throughout North Waziristan.  Collection over the past week indicates a concentration of Arabs IVO objective area. 

Result: 6 x EKIA; 7 x NC KIA, 7 x detainees 

(S) Summary: HAF departed for Orgun-E to conduct link-up and posture to the objective immediately after pre-assault fires.  On order, 5 rockets were launched and destroyed structures on the objective (NAI 2).  The HAF quickly inserted the assault force into the HLZ.  ISR reported multiple UIMs leaving the objective area.  The assault force quickly conducted dismounted movement to the target area and established containment on the south side of the objective.  During the initial assault, dedicated air assets engaged multiple MAMs squirting off the objective area.  GFC assessed 3 x EKIA squirters north and 3 x EKIA squirters south of the compound were neutralized from air asset fires.  The assault force quickly maneuvered with a SQD element on the remaining squirters.  The squirter element detained 12 x MAMs and returned to the objective area.  GFC passed initial assessment of 7 x NC KIA (children).  During initial questioning, it was assessed that the children were not allowed out of the building, due to UIMs presence within the compound.  The assault force was able to uncover 1 x NC child from the rubble.  The MED TM immediately cleared debris form the mouth and performed CPR to revive  the child for 20 minutes.  Due to time restrictions, TF CDR launched QRF element to action a follow-on target (NAI 5).  They quickly contained the objective and initiated the assault.  The objective was secured and the assault force initially detained 6 x MAMs.  The GFC recommended that 7 MAMs be detained for additional questioning.  The TF CDR assessed that the assault force will continue SSE.  The local governor was notified of the current situation and requests for assistance were made to cordon the AO with support from ANP and local coalition forces in search of HVI.  A PRT is enroute to AO.

Organization(s) Involved: AL QAIDA,FOREIGN FIGHTERS
02 JUL 2007, RCC HQ INTSUM 183-07, NATO/ISAF SECRET

SVBIED THREAT WARNING

According to MoD G2, 3 suicide terrorist from Al-Qaida equipped with explosive vests, received instructions to entered Kabul on 29 Jun 07. Two of them are assigned to conduct suicide attacks against a staff buses of ANA and police forces (probably at main gates) and third one will commit suicide attacks against coalition forces in area of Pol-e-Charkhi.  Suicide attackers are between 14 and 15 years old. They are working under the guidance of IZMARAI brother of QARI BARIAL. END

G2 COMMENT: IZMARAI (or EZMARAI) would be one of the TB chiefs in TAGAB valley. He would be reported, as well, as QARI BARIAL's brother, a famous TB commander In TAGAB. It would not be surprising that QARI BARIAL would be one of the masterminds of these suicide attacks. 
In the RCC LNO report dated 30 June 07, a quite similar threat warning was issued. According to NDS, three suicide attackers aged 14 to 15 years old under the command of ABU SULAIMAN (ARAB) would have entered BADR ABAD area of TAGAB district of KAPISA. One of them would have been ordered to conduct a suicide attack against the governor of KAPISA and the other two have entered KABUL city area to attack ANSF/ISAF units.
The 'SULAIMAN' mentioned could be the Maulawi SULAYMAN reported in a HUMINT summary dated 05 May 07. He would have been involved in a threat warning regarding an SVBIED attack. The report was mentioning that Qari BARIAL would have given a Toyota Corolla to Maulawi SULAYMAN who would have loaded the vehicle with explosives. He would have given instructions to suicide attackers assigned to conduct the attack in PD-15 or PD-9. 
Maulawi SULAYMAN would be an active insurgent in TAGAB district. 
The two reports can be compared; the main difference would be the name of the INS involved IZMARAI vs SULAIMAN. Nevertheless the common denominator would be QARI BARIAL. It is also known that TB and AQ would act in concert when they have common interests. Thus it would not be surprising that AQ would provide volunteers for suicide attacks. END

G2 ASSESSMENT: Reading the different reports we could assume that there would be a suicide bombers network organized in TAGAB valley under the command of QARI BARIAL. Since a few months, his name has been cited a lot of times in various intelligence reports as being involved in the planning and organization of suicide attacks in Kabul area. TAGAB would be a place of haven for TB; a staging area where they can quietly set up attacks against CF and GoA.  
The target chosen in this attack would seem to match Mullah OMAR requirements. Indeed on 25 May 07, supreme Taliban leader Mullah OMAR reportedly issued a letter outlining tactics and strategies for the conduct of war in AFGHANISTAN promoting more asymmetrical attacks in IRoA. The letter directed Taliban commanders to coordinate attacks on Afghan National Police (ANP) checkpoints, assassinate high-ranking government officials, and increase their use of remote-controlled improvised explosive devices (IEDs), pressure-plate IEDs and suicide bombings. Moreover it was recently reported that representatives from Al-Qaida, the Taliban and other insurgent groups allegedly met in the NORTH WAZIRISTAN AGENCY of PAKISTAN, where they received guidances - purportedly from Osama Bin LADEN - to execute twice as many suicide bombings (CJ2 update 087 dated 28 June 07).
This threat warning should be considered carefully as it would seem to corroborate the information gathered previously. The attack carried out in KABUL on 17 June 07 regarding a suicide bomber that detonated himself inside a KABUL City Police bus carrying police instructors was the deadliest since 2001. If this happens again the impact could be huge in Afghanistan and abroad. That is what the INS would seem to look for.
However the 'detail that could not work in TB's favor could be the age of the suicide bombers that are still children. Usually they are reported aged at least 17 (more considered as young adults even if they are still youngsters).  END

Vehicles had pulled over on both sides of the road to let the CLP pass. The motorcycle pulled out from behind vehicles in the on coming traffic side and was driving towards the CLP less than 100m away. The TC of the lead vehicle used the EOF kit, to include siren and flashing lights. The gunner at the same time went through the EOF battle drill and attempted to wave the motorcyclist off to the side, switched to his M4, aimed at the area in front of the motorcyclist, and fired warning shots in front of him. The motorcyclist continued movement directly towards the convoy until the warning shots were fired. At that time the LN lost control of the motorcycle. The lead vehicle was slowing down preparing to stop when the LN impacted the lead UAH. The 2Fury medics began to assess him and provide aid.  The local national had internal bleeding and a head injury.  They were attempting to stabilize for movement back to FOB GHZ Aid Station.

Summary of Activities:Unit: PRT SHARANADTG: 2007-07-29

Commanders Summary:  (S//REL)  One of our CA teams is preparing for a mission next week to OMNA and CHARBORAN.  The PRT vehicle situation is eleven of sixteen UAH FMC.  Our LMTV is still NMC.  Two vehicles have critical parts on order.  We have four of four MK19s and four of four M2s FMC.

Political: (S//REL)  Our DOS Rep met with the Paktika Director of Tribal Affairs, Mirajudin Miraj.  On the current problems with the tribes, he said that Terwa and Waza Khwa (where Miraj is from) were better in terms of tribal relations, but tribal problems get worse closer to Sharana.  The most problematic is the Alikhel tribe, a sub-tribe of Sulaimankhel, which is close to Sharana.  Miraj said that not a single member of the Alikhel tribe is in the ANA or the ANAP, and they will not work with the GOA.  

When asked about his strategy for bringing the tribes together, Miraj said that there is a need to improve the economic situation of the tribes.   However, he was not able to articulate anything more specific, and said he cannot do anything to help, because he doesnt have funding to hold shuras (food, transportation costs, etc.)  DOS Rep asked why people would not attend shuras on their own, without receiving payment, when they had been doing this for many years.  Miraj said there are three reasons for this:  (1) the people have no education, so they are not able to reason when someone tells them to kill someone or plant an IED for money, and they are not able to see that they can make their own lives better by bringing the tribes together;  (2) they have no patriotism for Afghanistan; and (3) after 30 years of war, they have a culture of expecting things to be provided to them.  He said that in order to give people back their civic/tribal/Afghan pride, we must have three things: (1) education; (2) deal with Pakistan, which does not want Afghanistan to succeed; and (3) provide economic opportunities, because currently people will do anything for money, even if it means killing CF or ANSF.  

Miraj confided in DOS Rep that Abdul Hai, who was just appointed as the sub-governor of Waza Khwa, was previously the sub-governor in War Mamey.  While there, he was known to have associations with the Taliban, even giving them weapons from the district center.  He then went to Pakistan to work with the Taliban for 6 months, but was unable to be fully accepted by them, because he only agreed to kill Coalition Forces, not Afghan forces.  Now he has returned as the sub-governor of Waza Khwa.  Miraj said the Governor is fully aware of Hais past associations with the Taliban.  Miraj also expressed concern about Abdul Shokur, saying that he has purposefully done things to get police killed while they were working for him.  

Miraj closed by saying that the Coalition must do its best, because many people think that the CF are working with the Taliban.  When asked how people could think this, he said that there was no way the CF could NOT find the Taliban and defeat them if the CF were really trying, as the CF has superior technology.  DOS Rep explained that sometimes superior technology could not be fully applied against the enemy, because the Taliban is aware of the CFs desire to not kill civilians and accordingly hides in villages among the civilians so that they will not be bombed.  However, Miraj was convinced that the CF were not trying their best. 

The DOS reps assessment is that Miraj did not appear particularly effective, because he was mostly concerned with himself, and had a defeatist attitude about his ability to do his job.  He began the meeting by saying that the PRT always wants things from him (i.e. visits) but never does anything for him.  He said he needed a nicer office with chairs and carpets and asked why the PRT did not provide these things.  The DOS Rep explained to him that the mission of the PRT is to build things that will have a lasting effect for all the people of the province, not things that will benefit one person individually.  He complained that he could not do his job, because he does not have a nice office in which to entertain visitors, and he does not have an operating budget to hold shuras.  The DOS Rep asked if he had asked for funding from his Ministry, and he replied that he had not.  For every idea that DOS Rep pitched to him, he had a reason why the idea would not work---lack of education, Pakistan, security, lack of desire, etc.  He seemed resigned to the idea that the tribes in Paktika no longer work, and will not work in the future, and he seemed disinclined to work to fix that.

Information: (U//REL) Today the PRT received a pallet of PSYOP products from TF Fury.  The products included posters, handbills, and novelty school supplies (pencils, erasers, and calendars).  The PRT IO developed a story on the Ground breaking ceremony for a 5-room school in the village of Gul Laden, Sar Hawza.

During a recent mission to Gul Laden, Sar Hawza, by CPT Pierce, Civil Affairs Team Leader PRT Sharana, noticed that the children of Gul Laden were attending school under the surrounding trees.  Upon talking with the village elders of Gul Laden, he determined the need for a school in Gul Laden.  The village elders told him they have the teachers but not the facilities to properly teach the children.  CPT Pierce obtained funding for the school using Commanders Emergency Reconstruction Program funds.

On 26 July, the village of Gul Laden, Sar Hawza held a ground breaking ceremony for a 5 Room School.  Gul Laden village is located at the foot hills of the Sar Hawza Ghar Mountains and is very difficult to get to.  Due to the remoteness of the region the people have become very self sufficient.  To exemplify this fact, the ceremony was setup without any help from the Government of Paktika or Coalit",RC EAST,NEUTRAL,FALSE,SHARANA PRT,SHARANA PRT,None Selected,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42SVB8475566112,33.13362122,68.83656311,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,,,NEUTRAL,GREEN

All of this is subject to change.

The morning of the incident, around 1030L, the RCP hit an IED near the village. A patrol from C Coy responded and hit asecond IED. They identified 4x ACM responsible for the IEDs andcaptured two and thetwo others escaped.Theycollected a lot of SIGINTindicating that the individuals were still around. They were searching for the remaining individuals when around 1600L, 4x ACM were seen moving vicinity of the village. It is not clear if they were hiding in the village or just passing through. There was only one section of two vehicles involved in the TIC. They fired their 12.7mm MG at the individuals, but the weapon jammed. The ACM then returned fire. They then emplaced their mortars. They fired a total of 26 rounds according to one report. They fired over and then short and then three rounds impacted within a compound. One impacted on the roof of the house, one impacted in the court yard, and the last went through the roof and detonated within the house. There was a wedding celebration going on in the house, which explains the high number of casualties. As soon as the PBG soldiers saw where the rounds impacted, they moved immediately to the compound to provide assistance. The 4x ACM escaped. 

This information is still to sketchy to assess a cause for the inaccurate rounds. 

Current Casualty list:6x KIA (1x male, 4 female, one baby)
3x WIA (all female, one of which was 9 months pregnant)

All of the casualties were from the Jalal Zaid Tribe, but not all were from the village, because some were from out of town for the wedding. This will spread the negative effect to a larger area then itwould of otherwise. Today, there were 120 locals rioting at the gate ofFOB Waza Khwa protesting the deaths.  

I am not able to talk to the individual soldiersdirectly, because the formal investigation has to be conducted by their Prosecutor. His name is LTC Dariusz Raczkiewicz. He is currently in Ghazni and will be here ina day or two. The individuals conducting their informal investigation are a MP investigator, WO Humeniuk Karol and aCounter Intelligence guy named LTC Radoslaw Jagiello.

BACKGROUND

(U) On 22 Aug 2007 the UK Mirror published an article stating that some families of British soldiers deployed in Afghanistan had received ""hate calls"" from Taleban believed based in Pakistan. The report claims senior commanders believe the Taleban get the phone numbers by monitoring troops' mobile phone calls or from staff at Afghan phone companies. One of the newspaper's unnamed sources states that the use of mobile phones is ""a huge security problem"" and adds that ""any numbers going to England can be called, or used to get addresses to send poison-pen letters to relatives"". Numerous assessments on this topic have been conducted by different agencies (see References above) and this paper will extract the relevant details from each.

ROSHAN GSM NETWORK

(NU) Roshan is the brand name for the Kabul based GSM service provider. It was launched by Telecom Development Company Afghanistan (TDCA) Ltd. TCDA is owned by an international consortium formed by Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development, Monaco Telecom International, US based MCT Corporation and Alcatel SA.

(NSI) The Roshan Network is the largest provider of GSM services in Afghanistan. Its service area covers most of Afghanistan and also covers most of the major border crossing areas with Pakistan, Iran and Uzbekistan. Even when using a European or North American GSM provider (phone brought from home), the call is routed through the Roshan GSM infrastructure in Afghanistan. Every GSM provider in the world has the ability to locate and track a GSM phone as soon as it is turned on. This means that the Roshan network is able to identify which phones have been turned on in the ISAF HQ area and can further track their movements. Key leaders and VIPs should observe the recommendations set out at Ref F to avoid there locations and movements being tracked.

(NSI) Reportedly Russian SIGINT units assisted Roshan to expand its cellular service to provinces all over Afghanistan. During this time, Russian SIGINT units were monitoring ISAF and Coalition communications via the Roshan network. 

INSURGENT EXPLOITATION OF ROSHAN

(NSI) At this time its doubtful insurgents have the technical ability eavesdrop on conversations and numbers dialled from Roshan GSM. The insurgents do, however, have the ability to obtain data from sympathetic or coerced human sources inside the Roshan network (who obviously track calls) or from sympathetic foreign intelligence service personnel. In mid-November 2006, Taleban militants in Zharey District of Kandahar provided safe passage to Roshan equipment and personnel through their area to Sangin and Musa Qala districts of Helmand. Other reports indicate Roshan engineers were maintaining the network components under the observation of the Taleban. This offer of safe passage shows coordination at some level between Taleban elements and Roshan workers.

FOREIGN EXPLOITATION OF ROSHAN 

(NSI) Reporting from February 2007 indicates Pakistani intelligence service (ISI) is currently collecting and databasing all Roshan calls and numbers from Afghanistan. Reportedly, when a Roshan user places a call to any number - either inside or outside Afghanistan - the call is re-routed through Pakistan.  Normally a ""call diverted"" message alerts callers that this is occurring but commercially available tracking and listening equipment suppresses the alert, making it impossible for the user to detect diversion. Elements of the ISI and insurgents have cooperated in the past  and it is possible that intercepted cell photo data can be passed to insurgents on a regular basis.

There is evidence some foreign embassies and consulates located in Afghanistan are capable of sophisticated signals interception to include the least protected mobile phones. Embassies with known SIGINT capabilities currently targeting ISAF include Russia, China, Pakistan, India and Iran. Of these embassies, the Pakistani embassy is 700m from ISAF HQ and Iran's consulate is 1200m away.

ASSESSMENT
Roshan network is used extensively by ISAF members to call their friends and families in their native countries. Even if ISAF members are using phone and SIM cards brought from home, their numbers and the numbers they have dialled can be tracked and databased. Based on this information, both ISAF members and their families can be identified. Insurgents do not need sophisticated signals intercept equipment to obtain this information; persons with access to the information will provide it either willingly or through coercion. Harassment of ISAF member's families is cause for concern.  The immediate threat, however, is to those VIPs who routinely use cell phones. While these personnel are aware and likely careful not to pass classified information, their identity and location alone may provide enough valuable information.

On Afghanistan, both sides agreed on the need for a much more unified effort focused on counter-insurgency, with all other considerations integrated into it.  On counter-narcotics, the Under Secretary raised the possibility of embedding DEA agents with British forces; Thomson argued for interdiction as the priority, while affirming the importance of eradication.  He urged the USG to stay engaged with Europeans on support to the Afghan National Police.

INCIDENT SUMMARY:

Last night approx. 1745L, an ANP driving a Ranger smacked an ANA with the door in the bizaar.  The ANA was armed but not in uniform.  The ANP driver was not in a uniform either.  The ANP and ANA argued, and the ANA shot 3 civilians.  All are recovering in the hospital in Mehtar Lam 1km outside the FOB.  The ANA also shot the ANP Ranger.  At least 7 bullet holes were confimed.  The ANA confiscated the Ranger and the weapons of the ANP (3 AK-47s and one pistol).  The OIC of the ANP involved was a MAJ Abdula.  He is the OIC of the checkoints in Mehtar Lam and works at the big checkpoint just over the bridge on the way to JAF.  The ANP claim they fired no shots and gave up their weapons when the ANA demanded them.  The CoP was in a meeting when we arrived at the PHQ and I interviewed the driver.  The CoP left the meeting, met with me for 20-30 minutes, and then left again.  He confirmed the report we received.  The CoP stated he called NDS and the deputy Governor last night IOT get his Ranger and weapons returned and all items are now accounted for.  MOI and MOD were at the PHQ this morning investigating, according to the CoP.4.DETAILED REPORTING: 

ALTERCATION BETWEEN ANA AND ANP LEAVES 3X LN WOUNDED
(S//REL TO USA, AFG, GCTF, ISAF, NATO//FOR DISPLAY ONLY TO AFG) At approximately 201215ZSEP07 an ANP officer in civilian clothes struck an ANA officer, also in civilian clothes, with the door of his vehicle at the Mehtar Lam bazaar.  Other ANA officers arrived and pulled the ANP officer out of his truck.  An altercation ensued which escalated into shooting.  ANP claims they did not fire any shots.  According to Gen. Omaryar, Laghman ANP Chief, the ANA shot three civilians who are now recovering in the Mehtar Lam hospital. 1x LN received a GSW to the stomach, 1x LN received a GSW to the neck, and 1x LN received a GSW to the leg.  There are 7-8 bullet holes in the ANP officers truck.  The ANA confiscated the ANP officers weapon at the time of the fight, but the weapon was released in the morning at the prompting of Gen. Omaryar.  MOI is in Mehtar Lam investigating.  DOI: 20070920; Source: PCC

(S) Analyst Comment: This will damage the populaces view of the IRoA in Mehtar Lam and significantly aid the insurgency.  The IRoA should act immediately to condemn the injury to innocent civilians.  Tempers were likely high due to Ramadan fasting.  It remains unclear who initiated the attack and why.

After breaching the objective, the clearing element received effective small arms fire and fragmentation grenades from inside the target building.  5x US soldiers were wounded initially.  The ground forces then began to fire into the entrances of the compound and in the ensuing firefight 7x more US soldiers received minor shrapnel wounds.  The element pulled off of the objective with the wounded leaving an M-4 inside the compound.  The M-4 was in the engagement zone and ground forces were unable to reach it.  After the building was evacuated the ground commander simultaneously began setting up an HLZ for CASEVAC of the wounded and also initiated AC-130 fires on the target compound.  Once CASEVAC was completed 2x A-10s initiated fires on the compound dropping 2x GBU 12s (500lbs).  Following the bomb impacts secondary explosions and a fire were observed and were believed to have been caused by a buried munitions cache. TF 373 exfilled at 2246z and called QRF, C/2-508 (attached to TF White Eagle), to conduct SSE of the site.  The building was completely destroyed.

US, PBG and ANSF forces had all arrived on scene by 050230ZOCT07 and had begun SSE of the objective and a search in the village shortly thereafter.  The objective had been cleaned up and items hidden in what appeared to be an attempt to cover up the contact.  A motorcycle, exploded RPG rounds and machine gun links had been hidden underneath a blanket.  The owner of the bike is not known.  Additionally the M-4 with a PEQ-2A and an ACOG were found deliberately hidden underneath some brush along with a kit bag left by TF 373.  The kit bag contained some papers from the objective and a poncho liner.  Both the M-4 and kit bag have been turned over to TF 373.  The site also contained more exploded RPG rounds, small arms casings, 2x AK-47 magazines (empty) several Pakistani ID cards and various other documents.  During the search 4x males of military age believed to have knowledge about the contact were detained and have been transferred to the ANA Compound on FOB Waza Kwah for further questions from THT 45 and the NDS. 

6x KIA were found inside the compound. 1x adult female, 1x female child and 4x male adults, one of which was bound by zip cuffs.  Pictures of the compound and deceased have been taken and the finger printing of all deceased males has been conducted.  The bound man has been identified as the owner of the compound and it is believed that he was a prisoner/hostage of the ACM.

3x wounded LNs (1x 10 year old boy, 2x teenage girls) were brought to CF during the SSE and were CASEVACd to FOB Waza Kwah when 2Fury elements RTB.  One of the teenaged girls was MEDEVACd to FOB Salerno for treatment.  The other 2x wounded were released from FOB Waza Kwah at approximately 1230z.

The 12 US WIA are all in stable condition.  6x personnel are at BAF, 3 of which are RTD, while the other 6x personnel are at Orgun-E with the FST and the 373 surgeon still undergoing treatment.

BDA is as follows:

Summary of Activities:Unit: PRT SHARANADTG: 2007-10-06

Commanders Summary:  (S//REL)     CAT-A Team B traveled to Sarobi to conduct QA/QC and leader engagements.   They are on day 2 of a 5 day mission to assess the Eastern Paktika districts.  The PRT vehicle situation is eleven of seventeen UAH FMC.   Our one LMTV is NMC for a faulty front drive shaft.  However, the parts are on order.  We have four of four MK19s and four of four  M2s FMC.

Political: (S//REL)  The PRT CO, PRT CA Officer along with PBG CA Officer and DCO escorted the Provincial Chief of Police, Gen Mulakhel, NDS 5 Deputy, Nabile, and the Provincial Director of Tribal Affairs (native of the region) to the village of Laswanday in the Gwashta region of Waza Kwah, 36 hours following a TF 373 operation on Objective Wolf (42 SVA 34591 80079) which resulted in the death of 1 child, 1 woman, 5 males and the wounding of 3 others (1 small boy, 2 teenage girls of which one was medevacd earlier).
   Initial reception was uneventful. About 12 adult males were waiting in the area of the target compound. The group took a tour of the damaged compound while another villager was sent to gather the rest of the villagers from the area.  Villagers present indicated that all persons killed or injured in the attack were from the same family. [Leads to further question as to why one individual, the owners son, was found in the rubble with his hands tied behind his back.]
   The village males gathered outside the compound where Gen Miakhel addressed them. There were about 100 in attendance. This is significant in that there were more in attendance today than when we addressed basically the same group at the Gwashta bazaar (1 km down the valley) after an A-10 attack on an IED maker two months ago. In addition, this was a large attendance for an event during Ramadan. Possible explanation is that the villagers indicated they expected the Governor when they saw the helicopters approach. The group was well behaved and polite as they greeted us with no hostility toward government officials, US or PBG forces. 
    The villagers listened intently as ANP6 gave an impressive, engaging speech. Key points included the importance of education, how ACM elements prevent Afghans from attending school while they send their kids to school, how Taliban mullahs misinterpret the Quran for there benefit, Taliban hypocrisy in burning madrassas now when during the mujahadeen battle with the Soviets they didnt burn madrassas, and during the war with the Soviets how the Americans were widely considered Afghanistans friends but now they call them enemies of the Afghans. Gen Mulakhel urged the tribe to band together and resist Taliban aggression so that they wont end up like the family in the compound.
   General Mulakhel was very well received and talked for the better part of a half hour. An eloquent and very effective public speaker, he hit all the important points in addressing this incident repeating many times how the CF are here to help and are helping the people of Afghanistan despite what lies the Taliban may tell them.
   NDS 5 addressed the group for a short while and distributed Neighborhood watch handbills with numbers to call to report insurgent activity (may not have much of an effect as there is little cell phone coverage in the area and literacy rates are low in the area).
    Mulawi Sha Mamoud from Waza Kwah addressed the group. He is highly respected throughout the area and his speech stressed that the fault of the deaths of the innocent lies on the villagers who did not resist the insurgents and their anti-government activities. He stressed if the villagers told government officials about enemy presence in the area, government officials would come in and separate them from the enemy. He did ask the PRT Commander (in front of the group) to make sure they had reliable information before conducting these types of operations. 
   PRT Commander addressed the group and stressed the fact that Coalition Forces approached the Compound on foot and did not fire until they received fire and took casualties (i.e. the CF were extremely careful to avoid injuring innocent civilians even to the point of putting themselves at great risk).
   The District Commissioner, Abdul Hai addressed the group and stressed that he was attacked just last week while in the area and lost three of his soldiers. He chastised a villager who condemned the compound shooting while telling him his soldiers and other government soldiers have no choice but to fire back when attacked. After his impassioned speech about the attack on his convoy, there was little response nor protest. 
   The PRT CA Officer gathered contact information on the sole remaining brother who lived in an adjacent compound. There were two surviving young males (13-16 years old) from the attack, who were not present, but solatia payments for the loss of the children and female will be arranged through the District Commissioner. 
   The Director of Tribal Affairs stayed behind after the event to discuss items with the locals and return to his home for a visit. 

CO Comment: 
   There was a notable change in the attitude of the group between the last time officials addressed the group two months ago and todays event. Last time there were more protests that they were helpless against Taliban insurgents who come in with weapons and take food and money from the villagers. There was little or no protest today, instead, all in attendance listened intently to the officials speaking. These people live dirt poor even by Afghan standards. Im not why there was so little emotion from the villagers at this event. There was significantly more emotion in the village of Nanger Khel, 10 km to the northeast, after 7 women and children were killed by PBG mortars. Being that Laswanday has been the scene of frequent insurgent activity, it may indicate that the locals, while not supportive of this activity, were at least cognizant of these activities and believed it was only a matter of time before this group/family got attacked by Government forces.

The detainee is a female who was wearing a burkha with the vest underneath.  The detainee was most likely acting as a transportation means for the suicide vest, as the batteries for the vest were not installed in the vest but were carried in a separate pouch.  The vest was laden with C4, however did not have any ball bearing or any other shrapnel, again lending to the assessment that the detainee was only transporting the vest.

(S) TF Bayonet Comment: This suicide vest can likely be associated with TB facilitator Noor Mohamad who was reported to have facilitated the travel of 2 suicide bombers from PAK into Nangarhar and later into Jalalabad. The suicide bombers are planning to attack the Jalalabad Airfield. In addition an unidentified individual has been reportedly to be traveling along with the suicide bombers. The individual is reported to be bringing additional funds as well as explosives for the TB within the region. Noor Alam was allegedly responsible to receive the explosives which consisted of suicide vests that resembled ANA vests. In mid-October reporting indicates that the vests were brought into Noor Alams house by Nazo, Nazos wife, and Aziz. Noor Alam was waiting for the arrival of the suicide bombers in order to transport the suicide vests into Jalalabad in preparation for the possible attack. Past reporting supports that insurgents use females to transport explosives because ABP soldiers avoid searching females. Noor Alam is identified to be from the Shewa area, located in Kuz Konar. This suicide vest was recovered in Kuz Kunar District and then brought to the NDS in Jalalabad city.

TF Paladin arrived at the scene at 1445Z, and upon questioning of NDS personnel learned that a NDS source reported a woman was wearing a possible suicide vest.  AT 1200Z, an elderly woman 50 to 60 years of age was apprehended by Jalalabad NDS officers, at the Kuz Kuner Bus Station.  The woman was on foot and wearing traditional clothing.  After apprehension the woman was searched and was found to be wearing a suicide vest, after questioning it was reported that the elderly woman name was (Hasan Tari).  During questioning of the suspect she stated that she was only transporting the vest to its intended user in Jalalabad, whose name she did not give. The NDA took possession of the vest and notified EOD 

Upon arrival of the site EOD rendered the device safe. It appeared that while wearing the vest the suspect did not have a power source connected to the vest. The batteries were in a separate case in her pocket making the vest safe for transport. EOD took control of the explosives and trigger device. The vest was given to the NDS Officer (Hay Dar) for evidence in the prosecution of the suspect.  NDS personnel also took video and pictures of explosives and components of the vest. NFTR.

(S//REL TO USA, ISAF, NATO) TB To Conduct Kidnappings   A group of 15 to 20 TB members led by Qari ((Naqibullah)) plan to kidnap members of the UN traveling between Kabul (42SWD1682719461), Kabul District, through Jalalabad (42SQA5694572638), Jalalabad District to the Torkam Gate Pass (42SXC9304477715) of Nangarhar Province. The group led by Naqibullah is working with the coordination of retired Pakistani General Hamid ((Gul)). This group is targeting un vehicles marked with black lettering, which Naqibullah believes is an indicator that the vehicle is carrying high level UN officials or members of the UN intelligence service. The TB led by Naqibullah will only target UN vehicles with black lettering. The TB group led by Naqibullah will travel on the Kabul to Torkam Gate stretch of Highway One in at least two vehicles. One of the vehicles is described as being a black land cruiser with tinted windows, the TB members are armed with Russian or Chinese made pistols and AK-47 assault rifles. The 15 to 20 TB members are comprised of Afghan, Pakistani, Kashmiri, and Arab males.
The TB members led by Naqibullah will travel on the Kabul Jalalabad stretch of Highway One in at least two vehicles, to include the black land cruiser. One vehicle will conduct surveillance along the road while the second will be used to conduct the kidnapping. Once the TB have spotted a UN vehicle with black lettering, the TB will stop the UN vehicle by either using a barricade constructed from rocks and lumber or one vehicle will pull in front of the UN vehicle and force the UN vehicle to stop while the second vehicle follows the UN vehicle. The TB members will use the pistols to threaten the UN vehicle occupants. Should the TB members meet resistance in the effort to conduct the kidnapping, the TB members will use the AK-47 rifles to combat the resistance or kill the hostages. 
After the TB conduct the kidnapping, Naqibullah plans to trade the hostages for 10 prisoners currently detained in the Pol-e-Charki prison located in Pol-e-Charki (42SWD3437924478), Deh Sabz District, Kabul Province Afghanistan. The prisoners Naqibullah hopes to trade the hostages for include three Pakistani soldiers, ((Rahihullah)), and six other detainees. Naqibullah has been instructed by Gul to place a higher priority in securing the release of the Pakistani soldiers. The Pakistani soldiers are currently presenting themselves as Pakistani doctors in an effort to conceal the fact that the Pakistani soldiers are members of the Pakistani army. At least one of the detainees was found to have a cell phone inside Pol-e-Charki prison. In addition, the three detainees also have connections to Noor ((Adin)), the director of the International Red Cross near Camp Phoenix (42SWD2394722782), Kabul District, Kabul Province. Gul has been instructed by Adin to inform Adin personally when the kidnapping is conducted and to not advertise the capture to anyone else. Adin will then secure the release of the detainees, to include the three Pakistani soldiers and Rahihullah in exchange for Gul releasing the UN hostages. 
Naqibullah is a TB commander responsible for 15 to 20 TB members and is directly subordinate to Gul. Naqibullah is from the village of Ashpan (42SXE4673815181), Sherzad District, Nangarhar Province and is currently living at the Hadah farm in the Khalis residential area of Jalalabad City.

SUMMARY:
Security in Afghanistan
oThe greatest concern for Director Saleh is security along the highways, particularly in Ghazni and Zabul, where he believes government officials cannot travel without security.  He believes that the shift in Taliban focus from attacks on district centers to attacks along the highways is attracting recruits who are not actually Taliban but use the name to gain legitimacy, increasing the perception of the size, scope and strength of the insurgency and demonstrating GIRoA weakness.
oSaleh believes that there has been noticeable progress in Wardak, but it will be temporary unless it is extended to Ghazni and Zabul, as well as other areas.
oDirector Saleh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s second major concern is for attacks in the major population centers of Kabul, Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad, and Masar-e-Sharif.
oMG Rodriguez reported that there have been over 100 small drug labs destroyed in Nangarhar, primarily in Achin, with no complaint from the locals, and that the 101st brought an additional helicopter battalion that would assist with efforts there.
oSaleh reported that the #1 priority for the Afghan government is to fix the Ministry of Interior, indicating that the leadership was involved in considerable corruption.  He remarked that it would be up to the US to fix it.  He said he proposed to the British that they provide management classes.
Tag Ab
oDirector Saleh says that BG Razaq will serve well over Tagab and is a good commander.  At the suggestion of putting an ANA force in Tagab, MG Rodriguez acknowledged the possibility of using the Commandos.
oSaleh acknowledged that the Kapisa Governor is active HiG, indicating concern.
oSaleh noted that Qari Baryal, Ahmadi, and Safraz were all previously HiG who have turned Taliban, are not reconcilable, and must be &amp;quot;taken out&amp;quot;.  MG Rodriguez noted that there would be a meeting with the Kapisa NDS to determine how to approach this issue.
Pakistan
oSaleh believes that Hekmatyar is a reemerging figure being pushed to become more politically active, and expects he will be more influential in 2008 and 2009.  Saleh believes that it is in the best interest of Afghanistan for Hekmatyar to remain in his current position, and that his capture or reconciliation would destabilize Afghanistan, based on his influence in Wardak and parts of Kapisa.  They gave Hekmatyar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s last known address to ISI, but they did not action it and Saleh expects them to facilitate Hekmatyar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s move to another location.
oSaleh observed several actions by the Pakistan Military indicating their lack of will to commit to security operations in the FATA:
They have forces stationed at the port, where there is no immediate threat  forces that could better serve along the border.
Following an ambush on a PAKMIL unit crossing the tunnel into North Waziristan about six weeks ago, the commander called Maulawi Ahmadjan to broker a peace with the insurgent force.
They lost control of Alizai last month and are not attempting to retake it because it is not in their interest, even though it is in their country.
They have asked the US to allow them time to clear each insurgent group, one by one, hoping that they will be allowed unlimited time in which the insurgents&amp;apos;&amp;apos; focus will turn away from Pakistan and toward Afghanistan.
They know where Maulawi Kabir (travels to Miram Shah and Peshawar) and Anwar Ul-haq are, but will not go after them.
oSaleh assessed that Pakistan ISI and the Army will work to ensure that a weak Prime Minister is installed to preclude conflict with Musharraf.  He described the wide-ranging control that the Army had throughout the government and industry, leaving little under the responsibility of the civilian government.  He noted that there would be little change until a civilian government had real control.
Saleh predicts that General Kiyani will take a more active leading role as he realizes the breadth of his power.
oSaleh sees potential for the Quetta Shura to weaken and noted that the Miram Shah shura has turned toward criminality.
&amp;quot;Enemies of Afghanistan&amp;quot; flip-book
oMG Rodriguez provided the prototype &amp;quot;Enemies of Afghanistan&amp;quot; targets booklet to Director Saleh, describing that it would be provided to ANP and that it could be updated in the future.  When asked if it should only include higher tier targets or all targets, Saleh said that it would be good to start with this version.
Secure Communication
oSaleh reported that he has discussed the Afghan Secure Private Netork with GEN McNeill and MG Champoux and that ISAF is supposed work on it next week.
Logar NDS Chief
oMG Rodriguez reported that the new Logar NDS chief is working well with coalition and working to build trust with the ANA and ANP.
Release Requests
oDirector Saleh reported that the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Justice had confirmed that Abdullah Mujahid, who had been in US custody for 4 years and was reported to have been recently turned over to the ANDF, was not in Afghan custody, implying that he must still be in US custody.  MG Rodriguez said we would figure it out.
oMG Rodriguez reported that Ghulam Mohammad would remain in US custody for further questioning.  Saleh had little reaction and did not seem concerned.
oDirector Saleh asked that Zabit Zahir be released to the NDS in Kabul, rather than in Nangarhar, and said that he would personally take responsibility.
Request for Support
oDirector Saleh reported that the Afghan government has taken responsibility for the NDS budget, previously handled by the CIA, which would likely result in a 30% cut in the coming year.  Saleh asked that, if possibly, RC-East provide AK, 9mm, and PKM ammunition; any other supplies, such as boots; and construction materials.  He said that if this was possible, he would send officers from the NDS logistics office to facilitate.",RC CAPITAL,NEUTRAL,FALSE,"CJ3, CJTF-82",CJ3,None Selected,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42SWD1428720048,34.52199936,69.15567017,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,,,NEUTRAL,GREEN

(S//REL TO USA, GCTF, ISAF, NATO) Insurgent Plan To Poison CF In Nuristan Province On 01 May 2008, insurgent leader Mulvi ((Nasim)) met with associates at his home in Kowtalay Village (42SXD2664), Nurgaram District, Nuristan Province, Afghanistan.  Nasim passed out a substance he described as poison with instructions to add to food or drink CF would consume in local villages during normal patrols.  Once a Coalition Soldier ingests the poison, the substance will enter the stomach and the soldier will die.  (Source Comment - The poison is called //Osama Kapa// in honor of Osama ((Bin Laden)).  Nasim said a bodyguard of Bin Laden developed the poison.  I do not know how much poison Nasim has in his possession.  I believe this poison is available to other insurgent commanders in Laghman Province, Afghanistan.)  
Once a Coalition Soldier has ingested the substance and died, Nasim claimed three unidentified individuals will attack Forward Operating Base Kalagush, Nurgaram District, Nuristan Province with unidentified explosives.  Nasim believes once a Soldier has been poisoned, the remaining forces will be sufficiently distracted to allow a successful attack on the U.S. base.  (Source Comment - I do not know if the base attackers will be suicide bombers.) 
Mulvi Nasim is approximately 38 years old, 67 to 69 inches tall, of a medium build, and wears a full black beard roughly four inches in length.  Nasim has a small mole under one of his eyes and usually covers his face with a scarf during the day.  (Source comment-Nasim has squinty eyes, like a man from china.)  Nasim owns a shop in Kowtalay Village that sells general goods, and Nasim occasionally operates it himself.  (Source Comment - The shop is labeled number six, and Nasim will lock the shop if police or Coalition vehicles are in the area.  The shop is not continuously open for business, and is sometime operated by an unidentified relative.)
On 01 May 2008, Coalition Forces recovered roughly three grams of the substance.  (Field Comment - The substance appears to be a fine white powder and weighs roughly three grams.  The substance was obtained packaged in two clear plastic bags, and was subsequently packaged by coalition forces into two additional plastic bags, sealed in a clear plastic container, and wrapped and tapped in a black garbage bag.)

DURING THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT AN ANP POLICE OFFICER (IDENTIFIED AS ABDUEL JABAR ASSIGNED TO THE SARHHAWZA POLICE DISTRICT) WAS SHOT ONCE IN THE UPPER THIGH.  WHILE THE ANP OFFICER WAS BEING TREATED BY SPC WARD (PAKTIKA PMT MEDIC), THE REPORTING OFFICER NOTIFIED THE 2 BCT TOC AND REQUESTED A MEDEVAC VIA BFT (REQUEST SENT IN 0615 HOURS). AT 0700 HOURS, THE MEDEVAC ARRIVED ON SCENE AND TRANSPORTED THE PATIENT TO THE NEAREST CSH. THE REPORTING OFFICER CONDUCTED A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE AS HOW THE ANP OFFICER RECEIVED THE GUNSHOT WOUND. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ASSIGNED PAKITKA PMT INTERPRETERS, THE UNDERSIGNED DETERMINED THAT THE ANP OFFICER MAY HAVE BEEN A VICTIM OF FRIENDLY FIRE FROM HIS OWN ANP. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES (ANP OFFICERS), THE TRUCK ACCELERATED AND SWERVED INTO THEIR CONVOY. THE ANP OFFICERS FEARING THAT THE TRUCK MIGHT BE A POSSIBLE VBIED DISCHARGED SEVERAL ROUNDS AT THE TRUCK.  NO US FORCES FIRED ROUNDS.  AS A NOTE, FOB GHAZNI TOC WAS NOTIFIED BY CPT CURTISS (GHAZNI PMT CHIEF) AND BY THE FOB RUSHMORE TOC OF THE ACCIDENT AND THE NEED FOR ENGINEER ASSETS AND LOCAL ANP TO SECURE THE SCENE.

23 JUL 2008, TF CASTLE INTSUM 4144, NSIG

(SECRET//REL TO USA, GCTF, ISAF, NATO) PLANS OF MOHAMMAD HAMZAH AHMADZAI AND USTAD ASAD TO CONTINUE USE OF CHEMICALLY ENHANCED MUNITIONS IN AFG 
As of late june 2008, dr. Mohammad ((hamzah)) ahmadzai, an associate of tb commander abdul rahman ((habibzai)), planned to provide chemically-enhanced munitions to qari ((khalid)), a wahabi who sought to conduct unspecified attacks in konar province, afghanistan. Hamzah first met khalid in circa late may 2008 via ustad ((asad)), a chemical expert and hamzah's teacher. In early july, hamzah provided khalid two rocket-propelled grenade (rpg) rounds with chemical payloads that were intended to spread a poisonous gas upon impact. Due to his desire to continue acquiring such munitions, khalid had agreed to bring his operations in konar province under the command of habibzai. (comment: there was no further information on the timing or targets of any attacks khalid planned with the chemical munitions.)
Separately, hamzah had expressed an interest in acquiring uranium to be used in explosives for unspecified purposes but found it to be too expensive to acquire. The uranium was allegedly available from an unspecified factory in lahore, punjab province, pakistan, at a cost of approximately 35,000 pakistani rupees (pkr) for ten grams. (comment: at an exchange rate of 65 pkr to u.s. $35,000 pkr is equivalent to approximately u.s. $538.) Hamzah was thus seeking alternative means of creating a large explosion that could be used to attack the cf base near the afghan military training center in kabul city, kabul province, afghanistan. Hamzah planned to use six kilograms of the same chemical compound he used in the chemical-laden rpg rounds. As of early july, hamzah had not finalized plans for such an attack.
Hamzah originally obtained the poisonous chemical formula from ustad asad, who had been his teacher. Hamzah then implemented the use of the formula with rpg rounds. Asad learned his chemical skills from dr. ((salahuddin)), aka engineer ((salahuddin)), of punjab province, pakistan, who was located in iraq as of 2008. Salahuddin claimed to have learned his technical skills from pakistani nuclear scientist a.q. ((khan)). Asad claimed to have ties to numerous extremist groups, and he periodically brokered contact between hamzah and commanders seeking hamzah's expertise. As of early july, hamzah was attempting to make contact with unspecified al-qa'ida arabs via asad. An arab in bajaur agency, federally administered tribal areas (fata), pakistan, provided asad with remote controls for use with improvised explosive devices. 
Asad and hamzah were also assisted by ((rohullah)), who was the deputy for mohmand agency, fata, pakistan, for supai suhaba, a pakistani political party. Rohullah was in touch with habibzai via hamzah and asad, and he also claimed to be cooperating with tehrik-e.

(N/I C) Seven (7) Arabs (NFI) and four (4) Iranians (NFI) have been seen in SIAHVASHAN Village (41SMT3387), GOZAREH District, Herat province five days ago. They have joined GHOLAM YAHYA AKBARY (GYA) group. The seven Arabs are tied with AL MANSOUR, one of the OSAMA BIN LADEN Deputies. The Arabs are only in charge to carry out suicide attacks against U.S. and Italian troops or, secondarily, whatever foreigners personnel. The four Iranians belong to ""Intelligence"" unit of SEPAH-E-PASDARAN and they are supporting GYA in the anti-ISAF/GIRoA actions through intelligence and as well coordinating the GYA group activities. CTC Comment: Up to now, it is not still clear the possible target and the date of these attacks against ISAF/CF. The attacks by GYA groups will be carried out 1-2 days after the end of festivity, notwithstanding the Iranians are spreading fake propaganda about possible VBIED attacks, also against Mosques, before the Eid al Fitr (next 1st - 3th October).

The purpose of the patrol was to clear the route from PB NABI to a Red ISO container (GR 41 SPR 7355 5012) in order to link up with IEDD team moving from SANGIN DC and guide them into PB NABI for a UXO task. At 1203D*, the foot patrol consisting of 10 x GBR OMLT left PB NABI for the red ISO. When FF reached Red ISO, they established a cordon in order to wait for the IEDD team. At approximately 1255D*, at GR 41 SPR 73706 50328, 1 x OMLT personnel saw 1 x LN on a motor bike approaching his position from the South. He believed the LN was a suicide bomber. For the last two weeks, intelligence has repeatedly reported the threat of two suicide bombers on motorbike in and around the SANGIN Bazaar. When the poss INS was 35-40 meters form his position, he fired 4 warning shots  (5.56mm) into the close to the poss INS. The poss INS did not alter his speed or direction and continued directly for the OMLT personnel. At 20 meters away he fired continuous shots (details to be confirmed) into the poss INS centre of mass. The motorcycle crashed into the ditch and caught fire. 
On inspection the LN was immediately confirmed as dead and not a suicide  bomber. At 1345D*, FF brought the body to SANGIN DC hospital with multiple GSW to the chest and immediately redeployed to their previous position IOT escort the IEDD team to NABI to commence the UXO task.

***Event UPDATED*** According to FIR:
An ANP foot patrol (with GBR PMT) was operating in NAWA when it was attacked with SAF and RPG by up to 30 INS using multiple compounds as Firing Points. The patrol was suppressed by INS fire and only able to engage one of the compounds effectively. IOT extract from the contact, FF requested CAS as mortars were not assesed appropriate and decided that a laser guided munition would minimise the chance of collateral damage. At 191028D* CAS dropped 1 x GBU38 and INS SAF ceased. At 1300D* 2 x AFG Civ came to PB JAKER informing FF that 8 x AFG Civ had been killed, a compound was destroyed and 2 x jerabs of wheat were burned.

UPDATE 290122D* Written after receiving FIR. 
Whilst on ROUTE 611, a white salon car drove towards FF at speed. This was the second car to drive towards FF at speed since they had been moving down ROUTE 116, the first stopped as soon as the c/s issued a verbal warning. 
Whilst FF were carrying out a search of the first vehicle, the second vehicle approached from the north. This vehicle accelerated towards the centre of FF. Verbal and visual warnings were immediately given by FF in an attempt to get the vehicle to stop, but the vehicle continued to accelerating towards the c/s and failed to respond to the warnings. Consequently, FF fired a 5 rd at the vehicle, which by this point was at GR 41S PR 7422 5029. The vehicle came to a stand-still 10 metres from the c/s. 

FF approached the vehicle cautiously, at which point they discovered that the passenger, NAJAM NADEEN, has sustained a GSW to the left upper arm. NAJAM NADEEN is from MAUDA VILLAGE, KJI, and a member of the ALEEZIA tribe. NADJAM NADEENs brother, MUHIBULLAH who had been driving the vehicle, said that they had not been able to see the patrol in the dark, even though the car had two headlights in good working order, which had been one whilst the vehicle accelerated towards the c/s. They had been travelling from LKG and were on their way to KJI and had just stopped in the SGN BZR to make some purchases. 
The c/s immediately administered first aid and a 9 liner was sent to the Ops Room at 1945D*. Initial treatment was given by 25208746LCpl Nicholls. NAJAM NADEEN was bleeding heavily from the wound; FFDs were placed to steam the bleeding. Shortly afterwards, the patrol medic, LCpl Sparks, arrived and assisted with the treatment. The c/s was instructed by H10B to move the casualty, using the white salon, directly to FOB JKN Sangar 2. The vehicle was used as it was deemed the quickest means of transport. NAJAM NADEEN was received at FOB JKN Sangar 2 by H19 and moved directly to the medical centre for treatment. He was then CASEVACd by PEDRO to BSN. 
FF returned from the patrol at 2027D* and will be interviewed at the earliest possibility. Statements will be taken from the individuals who fired the shots, the Section commander and the Patrol Commander 
In the pre patrol orders, the intelligence brief strongly indicated the possibility of suicide bombers within the SGN BZR.

THE CREW FELT THREATENED BUT DID NOT PERFORM EVASIVE MANEUVERS. THE CREW COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE POO AND NO INJURIES OR DAMAGE WERE REPORTED. NFTR.
ISRD ASSESSMENT: CLOSE, MINOR, PROBABLE RPG THE ASSESSMENT IS BASED ON AIRCREW OBSERVATION AND REPORTING. THIS ENGAGEMENT IS ASSESSED TO BE A REACTIVE TARGET IN RESPONSE TO CF OPERATING IN THE AREA. RW HAD JUST COMPLETED AN INSERTION AND IT IS LIKELY THAT THE SOUND OF THE A/C ALERTED EF IN THE AREA. THE AREA OF RC-EAST, IN WHICH THIS EVENT OCCURRED, PROVIDED EF WITH COVER AND  CONCEALMENT DUE TO THE RUGGED TERRAIN. AS CF A/C TRANSIT AND CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN THE AREA, IT IS LIKELY THAT EF WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE OPPORTUNISTIC TARGETS. THERE HAVE BEEN 2X RPG ENGAGEMENTS WITHIN 12NM IN THE LAST 15 DAYS. OVERALL, THERE HAVE BEEN 32X RPG ENGAGEMENTS IN AUGUST, OF WHICH 18 EVENTS (~ 56%), OCCURRED IN RC-EAST. RPGS ARE THE SECOND MOST UTILIZED WEAPON SYSTEM IN SAFIRE EVENTS, COMPRISING 27% OF SURFACE TO AIR ENGAGEMENTS IN AUGUST. THIS IS LIKELY DUE TO THE WEAPON'S WIDE AVAILABILITY AND EASE OF UTILITY, AS WELL AS ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN TARGETING PEOPLE, VEHICLES AND A/C. RPGS REMAIN THE MOST LETHAL WEAPON SYSTEM USED IN THEATRE, ACCOUNTING FOR THE MAJORITY OF A/C LOSSES. THERE HAVE BEEN 2X SAFIRES WITHIN 10NM IN THE LAST 30 DAYS. 1X RPG VS RW (NO HIT), 1X SMARMS VS RW (NO HIT).

1. (S//REL TO USA, GCTF, ISAF, NATO//DISPLAY ONLY TO AFG) AS OF 17 SEPTEMBER 2009, TALIBAN FIGHTERS UNDER THE COMMAND OF TALIBAN COMMANDER HAJI ((MATIN)) WERE USING AN IRANIAN MADE ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADE (RPG) LAUNCHER TO SHOOT DOWN COALITION FORCES (CF) HELICOPTERS IN KORENGAL VALLEY //MGRS: 42SXD750630//, PECH DISTRICT, KONAR PROVINCE, AFGHANISTAN (AF). THE RPG LAUNCHER HAD MARKINGS IN PERSIAN FARSI THAT READ //MADE IN IRAN//. 

2. (S//REL TO USA, GCTF, ISAF, NATO//DISPLAY ONLY TO AFG) THE RPG LAUNCHER IS SIMILAR TO THE RUSSIAN MADE RPG, BUT HAS A SCOPE ON THE LAUNCHER THAT CAN BE ADJUSTED TO ZOOM IN ON OBJECTS FOR TARGETING AND PROVIDE DISTANCE TO TARGET. THE SCOPE ALLOWS FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO 300 METERS. (FIELD COMMENT-FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE TRAINING THE TALIBAN ARE CONDUCTING TO USE THESE IRANIAN RPG LAUNCHERS IS CITED IN DIIR-HCT41-0735-09.) 

2. (S//REL TO USA, GCTF, ISAF, NATO//DISPLAY ONLY TO AFG) THE RPG PROJECTILE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE NORMAL RUSSIAN MADE RPG WARHEAD IN THAT IT IS NARROWER AND HEAVIER THAN THE STANDARD EXPLOSIVE WARHEAD. IT ALSO TRAVELS AT A HIGHER VELOCITY THAN THE RUSSIAN RPG THE TALIBAN WERE USING IN KORENGAL VALLEY. THE PROJECTILE IS GREEN IN COLOR WITH A RED TIP. (REPORT COMMENT-THIS RPG ROUND IS BETTER FOR SHOOTING DOWN HELICOPTERS BECAUSE IT TRAVELS FASTER WHICH MAKES IT MORE ACCURATE WHEN SHOOTING A MOVING TARGET.) THIS RPG LAUNCHER AND PROJECTILE WERE USED IN AN ATTACK ON A HELICOPTER IN KONAR PROVINCE WHICH RESULTED IN THE SHOOTING DOWN OF A COALITION FORCES HELICOPTER.

UPDATE 020002D* 
STORY BOARD: The motorcycle approached the cordon extremely fast and did not respond to verbal and visual warnings. As such, one aimed warning shot was fired. The motorcycle continued towards the cordon and when they were within 50m lethal shots were fired at the centre of mass. This resulted in rider #1 shot in the ankle and he suffered a head trauma when he fell from the motorcycle. It is assessed that he DOW from the head trauma and not the shot. Rider #2 was shot in the thorax and DOW. There was a MEDEVAC MM(S) 10-01N which was cancelled when the med condition of both persons deteriorated from Cat A (as was orig reported) to VSA. It is assessed that the soldiers followed the proper EOF procedures; however, this will be verified pending the MP NIS investigation.

The only terrain features that Fox Company observed to the N/NW at the time a marijuana field and a large stock of corn. 
Easy Company had no units in contact at the time.  
At 1450, two patients were brought to COP Koshtay (E Co AO) by their father Khan, with apparent gunshot wounds (GSW).  Their father stated that they were from the village of Haji Wakeel which is approximately 15 minutes away via motorcycle from COP Koshtay.  They were also accompanied by a younger man, possibly a brother or a cousin. 
We believe that the village of Haji Wakeel may be located at (41R PQ 155 327); however, that information is based on an old map with the approximate position of the villages written on.  The father did not identify the direction of which the village was located.  
The first patient, female name Shamsia, age 2  had suffered a GSW to the abdomen.  The wound was bleeding heavily and the patient's stomach was distended. 
The second patient, a male named Esan Ullah, age 6, had suffered a GSW to the foot.
The father, Khan, stated that he was sitting in his compound with his children drinking Chai when rounds started coming over the wall.  The patients were struck immediately, and he brought them to COP Koshtay.
At this time, the source of the injuries is unknown.  The TIC from Fox Co is included in this report as it was the only event involving SAF in the area at the time.  Since we do not yet know what direction the village is from COP Koshtay, it is impossible to identify any particular force as the likely cause of injury.",RC SOUTH,ENEMY,,A SIGACTS MANAGER,F Co,CF,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,41RPQ1213027890,30.97921562,64.174263,FOX CO,A SIGACTS MANAGER,(ISAF) FFIR 3A. - CREDIBLE ALLEGATION OF ISAF / USFOR-A / ESF CAUSING NON-COMBATANT INJURY / DEATH,A SIGACTS MANAGER,ENEMY,RED

During clearing operations, the combined force encountered a man after entering a compound courtyard.  The man started to flee, but then responded to initial commands to raise his hands and stop.  Quickly thereafter, he suddenly ran toward an open doorway.  Based on available information from CCA, the man's prior attempt to avoid capture, and then a second attempt to flee, a member of ODA assessed the man's actions as hostile intent and fired four shots.  One shot wounded the man.  A medical officer treated the man and he did not need MEDEVAC.  After additional assessment, the man was released to village elders.

Shortly after the incident, the combined force discovered a woman who had been shot and killed in the same building.  The initial assessment was that a shot fired by FF killed the woman.  

Commandos and SF personnel met with the family and conducted an immediate KLE with the elders.  A condolence payment was offered and accepted by the family of the deceased woman.  Both the family and the village members indicated that they believed the shooting death was an accident.  

ODA has notified RC South, TF Zabul, and the provincial governor.

The motorcycle was driven by a single occupant who wore white robes and turban. Once the bike advanced the civilian convoy, and given his approach to the convoy, the last of the vehicles made the following warning signs: 
-Green Laser.
-Beeps.
-Signs with orange panel.

The motorcycle continued approaching the convoy, that's why warning shots were fired into the air, to which the motorcycle responded by increasing the speed. At that point, the vehicle proceeded to fire warning shots into the ground; being the attitude of the bike in that time to dodge the shots and continue its movement to approach the convoy. When it was about 10m from the vehicle, the driver was shot and he was seen falling from the motorcycle. 
The events took place in a short space of time during which the Team Leader of the vehicle was not aware in detail of what happened, so that when he was informed of the facts, due to the noise, the communication helmet and the situation, interpreted that just as an EOF, without realizing that the motorcyclist was shot down. In this situation, the Chief of vehicle proceeded to report that he had an EOF without giving the importance it has subsequently been demonstrated. 
The Leader of the whole unit did not receive that message because of the difficulty caused by jammers and the urban environment.
