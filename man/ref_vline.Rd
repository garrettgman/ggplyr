\usage{
  ref_vline(mapping = NULL, thickness = 0.2,
    fill = "white", ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{mapping}{An aesthetic mapping, usually constructed
  with \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}}.}

  \item{thickness}{the thickness of the line as a
  proportion of the overall glyph width. Defaults to 0.2.}

  \item{fill}{The color, as a character string, to be used
  as the fill if fill is not specified in the mapping}

  \item{...}{other arguments to be used as parameters in
  the reference box layer}
}
\description{
  ref_vline creates a layer of vertical reference lines to
  be plotted behind a layer of glyphs. Each line spans the
  full height of the glyph. The thickness of the line can
  be adjusted with the thickness argument. Reference lines
  make it easier to determine the location of an object
  within a glyph and to compare objects across glyphs.
  Reference lines can also convey information on their own
  through fill, colour, alpha, linetype, and (line) size
  mappings. By default the fill parameter of a reference
  line is set to white.
}
\details{
  ref_vline is a second order function. It returns a
  function that can be used to create a layer of reference
  lines with the specified mapping and parameters. The
  output of ref_vline is intended to be passed as the
  reference argument for \code{\link{grid}} or
  \code{\link{glyph}}.
